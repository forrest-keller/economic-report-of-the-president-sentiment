economic report of the president

To the Congress of the United States:
As we begin a new year, the American people are still experiencing
the effects of a recession as deep and painful as any we have known in
generations. Traveling across this country, I have met countless men and
women who have lost jobs these past two years. I have met small business
owners struggling to pay for health care for their workers; seniors unable
to afford prescriptions; parents worried about paying the bills and saving
for their children’s future and their own retirement. And the effects of this
recession come in the aftermath of a decade of declining economic security
for the middle class and those who aspire to it.
At the same time, over the past two years, we have also seen reason
for hope: the resilience of the American people who have held fast—
even in the face of hardship—to an unrelenting faith in the promise of
our country.
It is that determination that has helped the American people
overcome difficult periods in our Nation’s history. And it is this perseverance that remains our great strength today. After all, our workers are as
productive as ever. American businesses are still leaders in innovation.
Our potential is still unrivaled. Our task as a Nation—and our mission
as an Administration—is to harness that innovative spirit, that productive
energy, and that potential in order to create jobs, raise incomes, and foster
economic growth that is sustained and broadly shared. It’s not enough
to move the economy from recession to recovery. We must rebuild the
economy on a new and stronger foundation.
I can report that over the past year, this work has begun. In the
coming year, this work continues. But to understand where we must go
in the next year and beyond, it is important to remember where we began
one year ago.

Economic Report of the President  |  3

Last January, years of irresponsible risk-taking and debt-fueled
speculation—unchecked by sound oversight—led to the near-collapse
of our financial system. We were losing an average of 700,000 jobs each
month. Over the course of one year, $13 trillion of Americans’ household
wealth had evaporated as stocks, pensions, and home values plummeted.
Our gross domestic product was falling at the fastest rate in a quarter
century. The flow of credit, vital to the functioning of businesses large and
small, had ground to a halt. The fear among economists, from across the
political spectrum, was that we could sink into a second Great Depression.
Immediately, we took a series of difficult steps to prevent that
catastrophe for American families and businesses. We acted to get lending
flowing again so ordinary Americans could get financing to buy homes
and cars, to go to college, and to start businesses of their own; and so
businesses, large and small, could access loans to make payroll, buy equipment, hire workers, and expand. We enacted measures to stem the tide of
foreclosures in our housing market, helping responsible homeowners stay
in their homes and helping to stop the broader decline in home values.
To achieve this, and to prevent an economic collapse, we were forced
to use authority enacted under the previous Administration to extend
assistance to some of the very banks and financial institutions whose
actions had helped precipitate the turmoil. We also took steps to prevent
the collapse of the American auto industry, which faced a crisis partly
of its own making, to prevent another round of widespread job losses in
an already fragile time. These decisions were not popular, but they were
necessary. Indeed, the decision to stabilize the financial system helped to
avert a larger catastrophe, and thanks to the efficient management of the
rescue—with added transparency and accountability—we have recovered
most of the money provided to banks.
In addition, even as we worked to address the crises in our banking
sector, in our housing market, and in our auto industry, we also began
attacking our economic crisis on a broader front. Less than one month
after taking office, we enacted the most sweeping economic recovery
package in history: the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009. The Recovery Act not only provided tax cuts to small businesses and
95 percent of working families and provided emergency relief to those out
of work or without health insurance; it also began to lay a new foundation
for long-term growth. With investments in health care, education, infrastructure, and clean energy, the Recovery Act has saved or created roughly
two million jobs so far, and it has begun the hard work of transforming our
economy to thrive in the modern, global era.
4  | Economic Report of the President

Because of these and other steps, we can safely say that we’ve avoided
the depression many feared. Our economy is growing again, and the
growth over the last three months was the strongest in six years. But while
economic growth is important, it means nothing to somebody who has
lost a job and can’t find another. For Americans looking for work, a good
job is the only good news that matters. And that’s why our work is far
from complete.
It is true that the steps we have taken have slowed the flood of job
losses from 691,000 per month in the first quarter of 2009 to 69,000 in the
last quarter. But stemming the tide of job loss isn’t enough. More than
7 million jobs have been lost since the recession began two years ago. This
represents not only a terrible human tragedy, but also a very deep hole
from which we’ll have to climb out. Until jobs are being created to replace
those we’ve lost—until America is back at work—my Administration will
not rest and this recovery will not be finished.
That’s why I am continuing to call on the Congress to pass a jobs bill.
I’ve proposed a package that includes tax relief for small businesses to spur
hiring, that accelerates construction on roads, bridges, and waterways,
and that creates incentives for homeowners to invest in energy efficiency,
because this will create jobs, save families money, and reduce pollution
that harms our environment.
It is also essential that as we promote private sector hiring, we
continue to take steps to prevent layoffs of critical public servants like
teachers, firefighters, and police officers, whose jobs are threatened by
State and local budget shortfalls. To do otherwise would not only worsen
unemployment and hamper our recovery; it would also undermine our
communities. And we cannot forget the millions of people who have lost
their jobs. The Recovery Act provided support for these families hardesthit by this recession, and that support must continue.
At the same time, long before this crisis hit, middle-class families
were under growing strain. For decades, Washington failed to address
fundamental weaknesses in the economy: rising health care costs, growing
dependence on foreign oil, an education system unable to prepare all of
our children for the jobs of the future. In recent years, spending bills and
tax cuts for the very wealthiest were approved without paying for any of
it, leaving behind a mountain of debt. And while Wall Street gambled
without regard for the consequences, Washington looked the other way.
As a result, the economy may have been working for some at the
very top, but it was not working for all American families. Year after year,
folks were forced to work longer hours, spend more time away from their
Economic Report of the President  |  5

loved ones, all while their incomes flat-lined and their sense of economic
security evaporated. Growth in our country was neither sustained nor
broadly shared. Instead of a prosperity powered by smart ideas and sound
investments, growth was fueled in large part by a rapid rise in consumer
borrowing and consumer spending.
Beneath the statistics are the stories of hardship I’ve heard all
across America—hardships that began long before this recession hit two
years ago. For too many, there has long been a sense that the American
dream—a chance to make your own way, to work hard and support your
family, save for college and retirement, own a home—was slipping away.
And this sense of anxiety has been combined with a deep frustration that
Washington either didn’t notice, or didn’t care enough to act.
These weaknesses have not only made our economy more
susceptible to the kind of crisis we have been through. They have also
meant that even in good times the economy did not produce nearly enough
gains for middle-class families. Typical American families saw their standards of living stagnate, rather than rise as they had for generations. That
is why, in the aftermath of this crisis, and after years of inaction, what is
clear is that we cannot go back to business as usual.
That is why, as we strive to meet the crisis of the moment, we are
continuing to lay a new foundation for prosperity: a foundation on which
the middle class can prosper and grow, where if you are willing to work
hard, you can find a good job, afford a home, send your children to worldclass schools, afford high-quality health care, and enjoy retirement security
in your later years. This is the heart of the American Dream, and it is at
the core of our efforts to not only rebuild this economy—but to rebuild it
stronger than before. And this work has already begun.
Already, we have made historic strides to reform and improve our
education system. We have launched a Race to the Top in which schools
are competing to create the most innovative programs, especially in math
and science. We have already made college more affordable, even as we
seek to increase student aid by ending a wasteful subsidy that serves only
to line the pockets of lenders with tens of billions of taxpayer dollars. And
I’ve proposed a new American Graduation Initiative and set this goal: by
2020, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world. For we know that in this new century, growth will be
powered not by what consumers can borrow and spend, but what talented,
skilled workers can create and export.
Already, we have made historic strides to improve our health care
system, essential to our economic prosperity. The burdens this system
6  | Economic Report of the President

places on workers, businesses, and governments is simply unsustainable.
And beyond the economic cost—which is vast—there is also a terrible
human toll. That’s why we’ve extended health insurance to millions more
children; invested in health information technology through the Recovery
Act to improve care and reduce costly errors; and provided the largest
boost to medical research in our history. And I continue to fight to pass
real, meaningful health insurance reforms that will get costs under control
for families, businesses, and governments, protect people from the worst
practices of insurance companies, and make coverage more affordable and
secure for people with insurance, as well as those without it.
Already, we have begun to build a new clean energy economy. The
Recovery Act included the largest investment in clean energy in history,
investments that are today creating jobs across America in the industries
that will power our future: developing wind energy, solar technology, and
clean energy vehicles. But this work has only just begun. Other countries
around the world understand that the nation that leads the clean energy
economy will be the nation that leads the global economy. I want America
to be that nation. That is why we are working toward legislation that will
create new incentives to finally make renewable energy the profitable
kind of energy in America. It’s not only essential for our planet and our
security, it’s essential for our economy.
But this is not all we must do. For growth to be truly sustainable—
for our prosperity to be truly shared and our living standards to actually
rise—we need to move beyond an economy that is fueled by budget deficits
and consumer demand. In other words, in order to create jobs and raise
incomes for the middle class over the long run, we need to export more
and borrow less from around the world, and we need to save more money
and take on less debt here at home. As we rebuild, we must also rebalance.
In order to achieve this, we’ll need to grow this economy by growing our
capacity to innovate in burgeoning industries, while putting a stop to irresponsible budget policies and financial dealings that have led us into such
a deep fiscal and economic hole.
That begins with policies that will promote innovation throughout
our economy. To spur the discoveries that will power new jobs, new businesses—and perhaps new industries—I have challenged both the public
sector and the private sector to devote more resources to research and
development. And to achieve this, my budget puts us on a path to double
investment in key research agencies and makes the research and experimentation tax credit permanent. We are also pursuing policies that will
help us export more of our goods around the world, especially by small
Economic Report of the President  |  7

businesses and farmers. And by harnessing the growth potential of international trade—while ensuring that other countries play by the rules and
that all Americans share in the benefits—we will support millions of good,
high-paying jobs.
But hand in hand with increasing our reliance on the Nation’s
ingenuity is decreasing our reliance on the Nation’s credit card, as well as
reining in the excess and abuse in our financial sector that led large firms
to take on extraordinary risks and extraordinary liabilities.
When my Administration took office, the surpluses our Nation
had enjoyed at the start of the last decade had disappeared as a result of
the failure to pay for two large tax cuts, two wars, and a new entitlement
program. And decades of neglect of rising health care costs had put our
budget on an unsustainable path.
In the long term, we cannot have sustainable and durable economic
growth without getting our fiscal house in order. That is why even as we
increased our short-term deficit to rescue the economy, we have refused
to go along with business as usual, taking responsibility for every dollar we
spend. Last year, we combed the budget, cutting waste and excess wherever we could, a process that will continue in the coming years. We are
pursuing health insurance reforms that are essential to reining in deficits.
I’ve called for a fee to be paid by the largest financial firms so that the
American people are fully repaid for bailing out the financial sector. And
I’ve proposed a freeze on nonsecurity discretionary spending for three
years, a bipartisan commission to address the long-term structural imbalance between expenditures and revenues, and the enactment of “pay-go”
rules so that Congress has to account for every dollar it spends.
In addition, I’ve proposed a set of common sense reforms to prevent
future financial crises. For while the financial system is far stronger today
than it was one year ago, it is still operating under the same rules that led
to its near-collapse. These are rules that allowed firms to act contrary to
the interests of customers; to hide their exposure to debt through complex
financial dealings that few understood; to benefit from taxpayer-insured
deposits while making speculative investments to increase their own
profits; and to take on risks so vast that they posed a threat to the entire
economy and the jobs of tens of millions of Americans.
That is why we are seeking reforms to empower consumers with
the benefit of a new consumer watchdog charged with making sure that
financial information is clear and transparent; to close loopholes that
allowed big financial firms to trade risky financial products like credit
defaults swaps and other derivatives without any oversight; to identify
8  | Economic Report of the President

system-wide risks that could cause a financial meltdown; to strengthen
capital and liquidity requirements to make the system more stable; and to
ensure that the failure of any large firm does not take the economy down
with it. Never again will the American taxpayer be held hostage by a bank
that is “too big to fail.”
Through these reforms, we seek not to undermine our markets but
to make them stronger: to promote a vibrant, fair, and transparent financial system that is far more resistant to the reckless, irresponsible activities
that might lead to another meltdown. And these kinds of reforms are in
the shared interest of firms on Wall Street and families on Main Street.
These have been a very tough two years. American families and
businesses have paid a heavy price for failures of responsibility from Wall
Street to Washington. Our task now is to move beyond these failures, to
take responsibility for our future once more. That is how we will create
new jobs in new industries, harnessing the incredible generative and
creative capacity of our people. That is how we’ll achieve greater economic
security and opportunity for middle-class families in this country. That
is how in this new century we will rebuild our economy stronger than
ever before.

TO RESCUE, REBALANCE,
AND REBUILD

P

resident Obama took office at a time of economic crisis. The recession
that began in December 2007 had accelerated following the financial
crisis in September 2008. By January 2009, 11.9 million people were unemployed and real gross domestic product (GDP) was falling at a breakneck
pace. The possibility of a second Great Depression was frighteningly real.
In the first months of the Administration, the President and Congress
took unprecedented actions to restore demand, stabilize financial markets,
and put people back to work. Just 28 days after his inauguration, the
President signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the
boldest countercyclical fiscal stimulus in American history. The Financial
Stability Plan, announced in February, included wide-ranging measures to
strengthen the banking system, increase consumer and business lending,
and stem foreclosures and support the housing market. These and a host of
other actions stabilized the financial system, supported those most directly
affected by the recession, and walked the economy back from the brink.
But the Administration always knew that stabilizing the economy
would not be enough. The problems that led to the crisis were years in the
making. Continued action will be necessary to return the economy to full
employment. In the process, an important rebalancing will need to occur.
For too many years, America’s growth and prosperity were fed by a boom in
consumer spending stemming from rising asset prices and easy credit. The
Federal Government had likewise been living beyond its means, resulting in
large and growing budget deficits. And our regulatory system had failed to
keep up with financial innovation, allowing risky practices to endanger the
system and the economy. For this reason, the Administration has sought to
help restore the economy to health on a foundation of greater investment,
fiscal responsibility, and a well-functioning and secure financial system.

25

Even this important rebalancing would not be sufficient. In addition
to the problems that had set the stage for the crisis, long-term challenges had
been ignored and the U.S. economy was failing at some of its central tasks.
Our health care system was beset by steadily rising costs, and millions of
Americans either had no health insurance at all or were unsure whether their
coverage would be there when they needed it. Middle-class families had seen
their real incomes stagnate during the previous eight years, while those at
the top of the income distribution had seen their incomes soar. A failure to
slow the consumption of fossil fuels had contributed to global warming and
continued dependence on foreign oil. And a country built on its record of
innovation was failing to invest enough in research and development.
The President has dedicated his Administration to dealing with these
long-run problems as well. As the new decade opens, Congress has come
closer than ever before to passing landmark legislation reforming the health
insurance system. This legislation would make health insurance more secure
for those who have it and affordable for those who do not, and it would slow
the growth rate of health care costs. Over the past year, the Administration
has also worked with Congress to make important new investments to
sustain and improve K-12 education and community colleges, jump-start the
transition to a clean energy economy, and spur innovation through increased
research and development. These and numerous other initiatives will help
to rebuild the American economy stronger than before and put us on the
path to sustained growth and prosperity. Enacting these policies will help
to ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a country as full of
promise and as economically secure as ever in our history.

Rescuing an Economy in Freefall
In December 2007, the American economy entered what at first
seemed likely to be a mild recession. As Figure 1-1 shows, real house prices
(that is, house prices adjusted for inflation) had risen to unprecedented levels,
almost doubling between 1997 and 2006. The rapid run-up in prices was
accompanied by a residential construction boom and the proliferation of
complex mortgages and mortgage-related financial assets. The fall of national
house prices starting in early 2007, and the associated declines in the values
of mortgage-backed and other related assets, led to a slowdown in the growth
of consumer spending, increases in mortgage defaults and home foreclosures,
significant strains on financial institutions, and reduced credit availability.

By early 2008, the economy was contracting. Employment fell by
an average of 137,000 jobs per month over the first eight months of 2008.
Real GDP rose only anemically from the third quarter of 2007 to the second
quarter of 2008.
Then in September 2008, the character of the downturn worsened
dramatically. The collapse of Lehman Brothers and the near-collapse of
American International Group (AIG) led to a seizing up of financial markets
and plummeting consumer and business confidence. Parts of the financial
system froze, and assets once assumed to be completely safe, such as moneymarket mutual funds, became unstable and subject to runs. Credit spreads,
a common indicator of credit market stress, spiked to unprecedented levels
in the fall of 2008. The value of the stock market plunged 24 percent in
September and October, and another 15 percent by the end of January. As
Figure 1-2 shows, over the final four months of 2008 and the first month of
2009, the economy lost, on average, a staggering 544,000 jobs per month, the
highest level of job loss since the demobilization at the end of World War
II. Real GDP fell at an increasingly rapid pace: an annual rate of 2.7 percent
in the third quarter of 2008, 5.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008, and
6.4 percent in the first quarter of 2009.

Rescuing the Economy from the Great Recession
Thus, the first imperative of the new Administration upon taking
office had to be to turn around an economy in freefall. Chapter 2 describes
the unprecedented policy actions the Administration has taken, together
with Congress and the Federal Reserve, to address the immediate crisis. The
large fiscal stimulus in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the
programs to stabilize financial markets and restart lending, and the policies
to assist small businesses and distressed homeowners have all played a role
in generating one of the sharpest economic turnarounds in post–World War
II history. Real GDP is growing again, job loss has moderated greatly, house
prices appear to have stabilized, and credit spreads have almost returned
to normal levels. A wide range of evidence indicates that in the absence of
the aggressive policy actions, the recession and the attendant suffering of
ordinary Americans would have been far more severe and could have led
to catastrophe.
Yet, because the economy’s downward momentum was so great and
the barriers to robust growth from the weakened financial conditions of
households and financial institutions are so strong, the economy remains
distressed and many families continue to struggle. A change from freefall to
growing GDP and moderating job losses is a dramatic improvement, but it
is not nearly enough. Chapter 2 therefore also examines the challenges that

28  |  Chapter 1

remain in achieving a full recovery. It discusses some possible additional
measures to spur private sector job creation.

Crisis and Recovery in the World Economy
In the early fall of 2008, there was hope that the impact of the crisis
on the rest of the world would be limited. Those hopes were dashed during
the months that followed. In the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter
of 2009, real GDP fell sharply—often at double-digit rates—in the United
Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Taiwan, and elsewhere. The surprisingly rapid
spread of the downturn to the rest of the world reduced the demand for U.S.
exports sharply, and so magnified our economic contraction.
The worldwide crisis required a worldwide response. Chapter 3
describes both the actions taken by individual countries and those taken
through international institutions and cooperation. As described in the
leaders’ statement from the September summit of the Group of Twenty
(G-20) nations, the result was “the largest and most coordinated fiscal and
monetary stimulus ever undertaken” (Group of Twenty 2009). Just as the
actions in the United States have begun to turn the domestic economy
around, these international actions appear to have put the worst of the global
crisis behind us. But the firmness of the budding recovery varies considerably across countries, and significant challenges still remain.

Rebalancing the Economy on the
Path to Full Employment
The path from budding recovery to full employment will surely be
a difficult one. The problems that sowed the seeds of the financial crisis
need to be dealt with so that the economy emerges from the recession with
a stronger, more durable prosperity. There needs to be a rebalancing of
the economy away from low personal saving and large government budget
deficits and toward investment. Our financial system must be strengthened
both to provide the lending needed to support the recovery and to reduce
the risk of future crises.

Saving and Investment
The expansion of the 2000s was fueled in part by high consumption.
As Figure 1-3 shows, the share of GDP that takes the form of consumption
has been on a generally upward trend for decades and reached unprecedented heights in the 2000s. The personal saving rate fell to exceptionally
low levels, and trade deficits were large and persistent. A substantial amount

To Rescue, Rebalance, and Rebuild  |  29

of the remainder of GDP took the form of housing construction, which
may have crowded out other kinds of investment. Such an expansion is not
just unstable, as we have learned painfully over the past two years. It also
contributes too little to increases in standards of living. Low investment in
equipment and factories slows the growth of productivity and wages.

Chapter 4 examines the transition from consumption-driven growth
to a greater emphasis on investment and exports. It discusses the likelihood
that consumers will return to saving rates closer to the postwar average than
to the very low rates of the early 2000s. It also describes the Administration’s
initiatives to encourage household saving. Greater personal saving will
tend to encourage investment by helping to maintain low real interest rates.
The increased investment will help to fill some of the gap in demand left
by reduced consumption. Chapter 4 discusses additional Administration
policies, such as investment tax incentives, designed to promote private
investment. Higher saving relative to investment will reduce net international capital flows to the United States. Because net foreign borrowing
must equal the current account deficit, lower net capital inflows imply a
closer balance of exports and imports, which will help create further demand
for American products. The Administration also supports aggressive export
promotion measures to further increase demand for our exports. The end

30  |  Chapter 1

result of this rebalancing will be an economy that is more stable, more
investment-oriented, and more export-oriented, and thus better for our
future standards of living.

Addressing the Long-Run Fiscal Challenge
A key part of the rebalancing that must occur as the economy returns
to full employment and beyond involves taming the Federal budget deficit.
Figure 1-4 shows the actual and projected path of the budget surplus based
on estimates released by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in January
2009, just before President Obama took office. As the figure makes clear,
the budget surpluses of the late 1990s turned to substantial deficits in the
2000s, and the deficits were projected to grow even more sharply over the
next three decades. As discussed in Chapter 5, the change to deficits in the
2000s largely reflects policy actions that were not paid for, such as the 2001
and 2003 tax cuts and the introduction of the Medicare prescription drug
benefit. The projection of steadily increasing future deficits is largely due to
the continuation of the decades-long trend of rising health care costs.

To Rescue, Rebalance, and Rebuild  |  31

Chapter 5 describes the likely consequences of these projected deficits
over time and the importance of restoring fiscal discipline. It also discusses
the President’s plan for facing this challenge. A period of severe economic
weakness is no time for a large fiscal contraction. Instead, the Nation must
tackle the long-run deficit problem through actions that address the underlying sources of the problem over time. The single most important step that
can be taken to reduce future deficits is to adopt health care reform that slows
the growth rate of costs without compromising the quality of care. In addition, the President’s fiscal 2011 budget includes other significant measures,
such as allowing President Bush’s tax cuts for the highest-income earners
to expire, reforming international tax rules to discourage tax avoidance and
encourage investment in the United States, and imposing a three-year freeze
in nonsecurity discretionary spending; alongside a proposal for a bipartisan
commission process to address the long-run gap between revenues and
expenditures.

Building a Safer Financial System
Risky credit practices both encouraged some of the imprudent rise in
consumption and homebuilding in the previous decade and set the stage for
the financial crisis. Chapter 6 analyzes the role that financial intermediaries
play in the economy and diagnoses what went wrong during the meltdown
of financial markets. The crisis showed that the Nation’s financial regulatory structure, much of which had not been fundamentally changed since
the 1930s, failed to keep up with the evolution of financial markets. The
current system provided too little protection for the economy from actions
that could threaten financial stability and too little protection for ordinary
Americans in their dealings with sophisticated and powerful financial institutions and other providers of credit. Strengthening our financial system is
thus a key element of the rebalancing needed to assure stable, robust growth.
Chapter 6 discusses financial regulatory modernization. What is
needed is a system where capital requirements and sensible rules are set
in a way to control excessive risk-taking; where regulators can consider
risks to the system as a whole and not just to individual institutions; where
institutions cannot choose their regulators; where regulators no longer face
the unacceptable choice between the disorganized, catastrophic failure of a
financial institution and a taxpayer-funded bailout; and where a dedicated
agency has consumer protection as its central mandate. For this reason, the
President put forward a comprehensive plan for financial regulatory reform
last June and is working with Congress to ensure passage of these critical
reforms this year.

Rebuilding a Stronger Economy
Even before the crisis, the economy faced significant long-term
challenges. As a result, it was doing poorly at providing rising standards of
living for the vast majority of Americans. Figure 1-5 shows the evolution of
before-tax real median family income since 1960. Beginning around 1970,
slower productivity growth and rising income inequality caused incomes
for most families to grow only slowly. After a half-decade of higher growth
in the 1990s, the real income of the typical American family actually fell
between 2000 and 2006.

A central focus of Administration policy both over the past year
and for the years to come is to build a firmer foundation for the economy.
The President is committed to policies that will raise living standards for
all Americans.

Reforming Health Care
Health care is a key challenge that long predates the current economic
crisis. The existing system has left many Americans who have health insurance inadequately covered, poorly protected against insurance industry
To Rescue, Rebalance, and Rebuild  |  33

abuses, and fearful of losing the insurance they have. And it has left tens of
millions of Americans with no insurance coverage at all. The system also
delivers too little benefit at too high a cost. Comparisons across countries
and, especially, across regions of the United States reveal large differences
in health care spending that are not associated with differences in health
outcomes and that cannot be fully explained by factors such as differences
in demographics, health status, income, or medical care prices. These large
differences in spending suggest that up to nearly 30 percent of health care
spending could be saved without adverse health consequences. The unnecessary growth of health care costs is eroding the growth of take-home pay
and is central to our long-run fiscal challenges. These adverse effects will
only become more severe if cost growth is not slowed.
To illustrate what could happen to workers’ earnings in the absence
of reform, Figure 1-6 shows the historical and projected paths of real total
compensation per worker (which includes nonwage benefits such as health
insurance) and total compensation net of health insurance premiums. As
health insurance premiums absorb a growing fraction of workers’ compensation, the remaining portion of compensation levels off and then starts
to decline.

Chapter 7 describes the actions the Administration and Congress
took in 2009 to begin the process of improvement, including an expansion
of the Children’s Health Insurance Program to provide access to health care
for millions of children and important investments in the modernization
of the health care system through the Recovery Act. It also describes the
key elements of successful health insurance reform and discusses the progress that has been made on reform legislation. Successful reform involves
making insurance more secure for those who have it and expanding coverage
to those who lack it. It must include delivery system reforms, reductions
in waste and improper payments in the Medicare system, and changes in
consumer and firm incentives that will slow the growth rate of costs substantially, while maintaining and even improving quality. Slowing the growth
rate of health care costs will have benefits throughout the economy: it will
raise standards of living for families, help reduce the Federal budget deficit
relative to what it otherwise would be, benefit state and local governments,
and encourage job growth and improved macroeconomic performance.

Strengthening the American Labor Force
American workers have suffered greatly in the current recession.
As described in Chapter 8, long-term unemployment is at record levels.
The unemployment rate, which was 10 percent for the country as a
whole in December, is far higher for blacks, Hispanics, and other demographic groups. The decline in house prices has eroded the nest eggs
that many Americans had been counting on for their retirement. The
Administration has initiated many actions to help support workers and
their families through the recession and beyond. These actions range
from extended and expanded unemployment insurance, to measures
to make health insurance more affordable, to initiatives to promote
retirement saving.
American workers also face the persistent problem of stagnating
incomes. A key determinant of growth in standards of living is the rate of
increase in the education and skills of our workforce. More and more jobs
require education and training beyond the high school level, along with the
ability to complete tasks that are open-ended and interactive. But, as Figure
1-7 shows, the years of education U.S. workers have brought to the labor
market have risen little in the past four decades. And, as is well known, U.S.
students lag behind those from many other countries in their performance
on standardized tests.
Chapter 8 describes the Administration’s initiatives to improve the
skills of our workers. The Administration is pursuing reform to eliminate
wasteful subsidies to student loan providers, the savings from which will fund
To Rescue, Rebalance, and Rebuild  |  35

new investments in education. The Administration has proposed a major
initiative to support and improve community colleges, which are a neglected
but critical link in our education system. It has also proposed increasing Pell
Grants, and is taking steps to simplify the student aid application process so
that eligible students are no longer discouraged by a complicated process
from even applying for aid. All of these actions will help to achieve one of
the President’s key educational goals for the country—that the proportion of
adults with a college degree be the largest in the world by 2020.

Transforming the Energy Sector and Addressing Climate Change
Climate change and energy independence present a very different
long-run challenge. Continued reliance on fossil fuels is leading to the
buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and is changing our climate.
Left unaddressed, these trends will have increasingly severe consequences
over time. What is more, the United States imports the majority of the oil
it uses, much of it from sources that are potentially subject to disruption.
Chapter 9 analyzes how economic policy can play a critical role in
moving the United States toward a clean energy economy that is less dependent on fossil fuels and fossil fuel imports. Slowing climate change requires
36  |  Chapter 1

slowing the emission of greenhouse gases. A market-based approach,
such as that supported by the Administration and currently working its
way through Congress, can provide the signals needed to accomplish this
slowing of emissions efficiently and with minimal disruptions.
The support for research and development (R&D) and incentives
for investment in clean energy technologies and energy efficiency in the
Recovery Act and the President’s budget, as well as in the energy and climate
legislation, can help foster the transition to a clean energy economy and
spur growth in vital new industries. These new industries have the potential
to reinvigorate the American manufacturing sector and generate secure,
high-quality jobs.

Fostering Productivity Growth Through Innovation and Trade
The ultimate driver of growth in average standards of living is
productivity growth. Increased investment in capital and in the skills of our
workforce are two important sources of that growth. Chapter 10 examines
two other sources of productivity gains: innovation and international trade.
Innovation comes from many sources. But a central one is investment
in R&D. Figure 1-8 shows the share of GDP devoted to R&D over the past
50 years. In the mid-1960s, R&D constituted a larger share of total spending

than it has in the past decade. And in some other countries, such as Korea,
Sweden, and Japan, R&D spending is a larger fraction of GDP than in the
United States. The President is committed to raising the share of output
devoted to R&D to 3 percent, so that America can continue to be a leader
in new technologies and American workers and businesses can benefit from
more rapid economic growth.
Through the Recovery Act and other measures, the Administration
is investing both directly in basic scientific research and development and
in the infrastructure to support that research. Most innovation, however,
comes from the private sector. Here, the Administration is providing critical
incentives for R&D both in general and in such vital areas as clean energy
technologies. The Administration is also pursuing a wide range of policies
to support the small businesses that contribute so much to technological
progress—policies ranging from programs to maintain the flow of credit to
small businesses to health insurance reform that will help level the playing
field between small and large businesses.
Finally, international trade can be an important source of productivity
growth and incentives for innovation. Trade has the potential to allow the
U.S. economy to expand output in areas where it is more productive and
to enable higher-productivity firms to expand. Access to a world market
encourages American firms to invest in the research needed to become technological leaders. Through these routes, a free and fair trade regime can play
an important part in lifting living standards in the long run. But for trade to
play this role, it is essential to enforce existing trade rules and pursue policies
that ensure that the benefits of trade are widely shared.

Conclusion
The past year has been one of great challenge for all Americans.
Nearly every family has been touched in some way by the fallout from the
crisis in financial markets, the drying up of credit, and the rise in unemployment. These challenges, moreover, have come after a decade in which
ordinary Americans have seen their living standards stagnate, their health
insurance become less secure, and their environment deteriorate.
The rest of this Report describes in more detail the actions the
President has taken to end the recession, foster stable growth by rebalancing
production and demand, and rebuild the foundation of the American
economy. More fundamentally, it describes the work that remains to be
done to create the prosperous, dynamic economy the American people need
and deserve.

RESCUING THE ECONOMY
FROM THE GREAT RECESSION

T

he first and most fundamental task the Administration faced when
President Obama took office was to rescue an economy in freefall. In
November 2008, employment was declining at a rate of more than half a
million jobs per month, and credit markets were stretched almost to the
breaking point. As the economy entered 2009, the decline accelerated, with
job loss in January reaching almost three-quarters of a million. The President
responded by working with Congress to take unprecedented actions. These
steps, together with measures taken by the Federal Reserve and other financial regulators, have succeeded in stabilizing the economy and beginning
the process of healing a severely shaken economic and financial system. But
much work remains. With high unemployment and continued job losses, it
is clear that recovery must remain the key focus of 2010.

An Economy in Freefall
According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the United
States entered a recession in December 2007. Unlike most postwar recessions, this downturn was not caused by tight monetary policy aimed at
curbing inflation. Although economists will surely analyze this downturn
extensively in the years to come, there is widespread consensus that its
central precipitating factor was a boom and bust in asset prices, especially
house prices. The boom was fueled in part by irresponsible and in some
cases predatory lending practices, risky investment strategies, faulty credit
ratings, and lax regulation. When the boom ended, the result was widespread defaults and crippling blows to key financial institutions, magnifying
the decline in house prices and causing enormous spillovers to the remainder
of the economy.

39

The Run-Up to the Recession
The rise in house prices during the boom was remarkable. As Figure
2-1 shows, real house prices almost doubled between 1997 and 2006. By
2006, they were more than 50 percent above the highest level they had
reached in the 20th century.

Stock prices also rose rapidly. The Standard and Poor’s (S&P) 500,
for example, rose 101 percent between its low in 2002 and its high in 2007.
That rise, though dramatic, was not unprecedented. Indeed, in the five
years before its peak in March 2000, during the “tech bubble,” the S&P 500
rose 205 percent, while the more technology-focused NASDAQ index rose
506 percent.
The run-up in asset prices was associated with a surge in construction and consumer spending. Residential construction rose sharply as
developers responded to the increase in housing demand. From the fourth
quarter of 2001 to the fourth quarter of 2005, the residential investment
component of real GDP rose at an average annual rate of nearly 8 percent.
Similarly, consumers responded to the increases in the value of their assets
by continuing to spend freely. Saving rates, which had been declining since
the early 1980s, fell to about 2 percent during the two years before the recession. This spending was facilitated by low interest rates and easy credit, with
household borrowing rising faster than incomes.
40  |  Chapter 2

The Downturn
House prices began to drop in some markets in 2006, and then
nationally beginning in 2007. This process was gradual at first, with prices
measured using the LoanPerformance house price index declining just
3½ percent nationally between January and June 2007. Lenders had lent
aggressively during the boom, often providing mortgages whose soundness
hinged on continued house price appreciation. As a result, the comparatively modest decline in house prices threatened large losses on subprime
residential mortgages (the riskiest class of mortgages), as well as on the
slightly higher-quality “Alt-A” mortgages. As the availability of mortgage
credit tightened, the downward pressure on real estate prices intensified.
National house prices declined 6 percent between June and December 2007.
The negative feedback between credit availability and the housing
market weighed on household and business confidence, restraining consumer
spending and business investment. Although residential construction
led the slowdown in real activity through 2007, by early 2008 outlays for
consumer goods and services and business equipment and software had
decelerated sharply, and total employment was beginning to decline. Real
gross domestic product (GDP) fell slightly in the first quarter of 2008.
In February 2008, Congress passed a temporary tax cut. Figure 2-2
shows real after-tax (or disposable) income and consumer spending before
and after rebate checks were issued. Consumption was maintained despite
a tremendous decline in household wealth over the same period. Total
household and nonprofit net worth declined 9.1 percent between June
2007 and June 2008. Microeconomic studies of consumer behavior in this
episode confirm the role of the tax rebate in maintaining spending (Broda
and Parker 2008; Sahm, Shapiro, and Slemrod 2009). The fact that real GDP
reversed course and grew in the second quarter of 2008 is further tribute
to the helpfulness of the policy. But, in part because of the lack of robust,
sustained stimulus, growth did not continue.
Financial institutions had invested heavily in assets whose values were
tied to the value of mortgages. For many reasons—the opacity of the instruments, the complexity of financial institutions’ balance sheets and their
“off-balance-sheet” exposures, the failure of credit-rating agencies to accurately identify the riskiness of the assets, and poor regulatory oversight—the
extent of the institutions’ exposure to mortgage default risk was obscured.
When mortgage defaults rose, the result was unexpectedly large losses to
many financial institutions.
In the fall of 2008, the nature of the downturn changed dramatically.
More rapid declines in asset prices generated further loss of confidence
in the ability of some of the world’s largest financial institutions to honor

their obligations. In September, the Lehman Brothers investment bank
declared bankruptcy, and other large financial firms (including American
International Group, Washington Mutual, and Merrill Lynch) were forced
to seek government aid or to merge with stronger institutions. What
followed was a rush to liquidity and a cascading of retrenchment that had
many of the features of a classic financial panic.
Risk spreads shot up to extraordinary levels. Figure 2-3 shows both
the TED spread and Moody’s BAA-AAA spread. The TED spread is the
difference between the rate on short-term loans among banks and a safe
short-term Treasury interest rate. The BAA-AAA spread is the difference
between the interest rates on high-grade and medium-grade corporate
bonds. Both spreads rose dramatically during the heart of the panic. Indeed,
one way to put the spike in the BAA-AAA spread in perspective is to note
that the same spread barely moved during the Great Crash of the stock
market in 1929, and rose by only about half as much during the first wave of
banking panics in 1930 as it did in the fall of 2008.
The same loss of confidence shown by the rise in credit spreads
translated into declining asset prices of all sorts. The S&P 500 declined
29 percent in the second half of 2008. Real house prices tumbled another
11 percent over the same period (see Figure 2-1). All told, household and

nonprofit net worth declined 20 percent between December 2007 and
December 2008, or by about $13 trillion. Again, a useful way to calibrate
the size of this shock is to note that in 1929, household wealth declined only
3 percent—about one-seventh as much as in 2008. This is another indication that the shocks hitting the U.S. economy in 2008 were enormous.
The decline in wealth had a severe impact on consumer spending.
This key component of aggregate demand, which accounts for roughly
70 percent of GDP and is traditionally quite stable, declined at an annual
rate of 3.5 percent in the third quarter of 2008 and 3.1 percent in the fourth
quarter. Some of this large decline may have also reflected the surge in
uncertainty about future incomes. Not only did asset prices fall sharply,
leading to the decline in wealth; they also became dramatically more volatile. The standard deviation of daily stock returns in the fourth quarter, for
example, was 4.3 percentage points, even larger than in the first months of
the Great Depression.
The financial panic led to a precipitous decline in lending. Bank
credit continued to rise over the latter portion of 2008, as households and
firms that had lost access to other forms of credit turned to banks. However,
bank loans declined sharply in the first and second quarters of 2009 as banks
tightened their terms and standards. Other sources of credit showed even
Rescuing the Economy from the Great Recession  |  43

more substantial declines. One particularly important market is that for
commercial paper (short-term notes issued by firms to finance key operating
costs such as payroll and inventory). The market for lower-tier nonfinancial
(A2/P2) commercial paper collapsed in the fall of 2008, with the average
daily value of new issues falling from $8.0 billion in the second quarter of
2008 to $4.3 billion in the fourth quarter. In addition, securitization of
automobile loans, credit card receivables, student loans, and commercial
mortgages ground to a halt.
This freezing of credit markets, together with the decline in wealth
and confidence, caused consumer spending and residential investment to
fall sharply. Real GDP declined at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the third
quarter of 2008, 5.4 percent in the fourth quarter, and 6.4 percent in the
first quarter of 2009. Industrial production, which had been falling steadily
over the first eight months of 2008, plummeted in the final four months—
dropping at an annual rate of 18 percent.
Many industries were battered by the financial crisis and the resulting
economic downturn. The American automobile industry was hit particularly hard. Sales of light motor vehicles, which had exceeded 16 million
units every year from 1999 to 2007, fell to an annual rate of only 9.5 million
in the first quarter of 2009. Employment in the motor vehicle and parts
industry declined by 240,000 over the 12 months through January 2009.
Two domestic manufacturers, General Motors (GM) and Chrysler, required
emergency loans in late December 2008 and early January 2009 to avoid
disorderly bankruptcy.
The most disturbing manifestation of the rapid slowdown in the
economy was the dramatic increase in job loss. Over the first months of
2008, job losses were typically between 100,000 and 200,000 per month.
In October, the economy lost 380,000 jobs; in November, 597,000 jobs.
By January, the economy was losing jobs at a rate of 741,000 per month.
Commensurate with this terrible rate of job loss, the unemployment rate
rose rapidly—from 6.2 percent in September 2008 to 7.7 percent in January
2009. It then continued to rise by roughly one-half of a percentage point per
month through the winter and spring; it reached 9.4 percent in May, and
ended the year at 10.0 percent.

Wall Street and Main Street
As described in more detail later, policymakers have focused much
of their response to the crisis on stabilizing the financial system. Many
Americans are troubled by these policies. Because to a large extent it was
the actions of credit market participants that led to the crisis, people ask why
policymakers should take actions focused on restoring credit markets.
44  |  Chapter 2

The basic reason for these policies is that the health of credit markets
is critically important to the functioning of our economy. Large firms use
commercial paper to finance their biweekly payrolls and pay suppliers for
materials to keep production lines going. Small firms rely on bank loans to
meet their payrolls and pay for supplies while they wait for payment of their
accounts receivable. Home purchases depend on mortgages; automobile
purchases depend on car loans; college educations depend on student loans;
and purchases of everyday items depend on credit cards.
The events of the past two years provide a dramatic demonstration
of the importance of credit in the modern economy. As the President said
in his inaugural address, “Our workers are no less productive than when
this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services
no less needed.” Yet developments in financial markets—rises and falls
in home and equity prices and in the availability of credit—have led to a
collapse of spending, and hence to a precipitous decline in output and to
unemployment for millions.
Numerous academic studies before the crisis had also shown that the
availability of credit is critical to investment, hiring, and production. One
study, for example, found that when a parent company earns high profits
and so has less need to rely on credit, the additional funds lead to higher
investment by subsidiaries in completely unrelated lines of business (Lamont
1997). Another found that when a small change in a firm’s circumstances
frees up a large amount of funds that would otherwise have to go to pension
contributions, the result is a large change in spending on capital goods
(Rauh 2006). Other studies have shown that when the Federal Reserve
tightens monetary policy, small firms, which typically have more difficulty
obtaining financing, are hit especially hard (Gertler and Gilchrist 1994), and
firms without access to public debt markets cut their inventories much more
sharply than firms that have such access (Kashyap, Lamont, and Stein 1994).
Research before the crisis had also found that financial market disruptions could affect the real economy. Ben Bernanke, who is now Chairman
of the Federal Reserve, demonstrated a link between the disruption of
lending caused by bank failures and the worsening of the Great Depression
(Bernanke 1983). A smaller but more modern example is provided by the
impact of Japan’s financial crisis in the 1990s on the United States: construction lending, new construction, and construction employment were more
adversely affected in U.S. states where subsidiaries of Japanese banks had
a larger role, and thus where credit availability was more affected by the
collapse of Japan’s bubble (Peek and Rosengren 2000). That a financial
disruption in a trading partner can have a detectable adverse impact on our
economy through its impact on credit availability suggests that the effect of
Rescuing the Economy from the Great Recession  |  45

a full-fledged financial crisis at home would be enormous—an implication
that, sadly, has proven to be correct.
Finally, microeconomic evidence from the recent crisis also shows the
importance of the financial system to the real economy. For example, firms
that happened to have long-term debt coming due after the crisis began,
and thus faced high costs of refinancing, cut their investment much more
than firms that did not (Almeida et al. 2009). Another study found that a
majority of corporate chief financial officers surveyed reported that their
firms faced financing constraints during the crisis, and that the constrained
firms on average planned to reduce investment spending, research and
development, and employment sharply compared with the unconstrained
firms (Campello, Graham, and Harvey 2009).
In short, the goal of the policies to stabilize the financial system was
not to help financial institutions. The goal was to help ordinary Americans.
When the financial system is not working, individuals and businesses cannot
get credit, demand and production plummet, and job losses skyrocket.
Thus, an essential step in healing the real economy is to heal the financial
system. The alternative of letting financial institutions suffer the consequences of their mistakes would have led to a collapse of credit markets and
vastly greater suffering for millions and millions of Americans.
The policies to rescue the financial sector were, however, costly, and
often had the side effect of benefiting the very institutions whose irresponsible actions contributed to the crisis. That is one reason that the President
has endorsed a Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee on the largest financial
firms to repay the Federal Government for its extraordinary actions. As
discussed in Chapter 6, the Administration has also proposed a comprehensive plan for financial regulatory reform that will help ensure that Wall
Street does not return to the risky practices that were a central cause of the
recent crisis.

The Unprecedented Policy Response
Given the magnitude of the shocks that hit the economy in the fall of
2008 and the winter of 2009, the downturn could have turned into a second
Great Depression. That it has not is a tribute to the aggressive and effective policy response. This response involved the Federal Reserve and other
financial regulators, the Administration, and Congress. The policy tools
were similarly multifaceted, including monetary policy, financial market
interventions, fiscal policy, and policies targeted specifically at housing.

46  |  Chapter 2

Monetary Policy
The first line of defense against a weak economy is the interest rate
policy of the independent Federal Reserve. By increasing or decreasing the
quantity of reserves it supplies to the banking system, the Federal Reserve
can lower or raise the Federal funds rate, which is the interest rate at which
banks lend to one another. The funds rate influences other interest rates
in the economy and so has important effects on economic activity. Using
changes in the target level of the funds rate as their main tool of countercyclical policy, monetary policymakers had kept inflation low and the real
economy remarkably stable for more than two decades.
The Federal Reserve has used interest rate policy aggressively in the
recent episode. The target level of the funds rate at the beginning of 2007
was 5¼ percent. The Federal Reserve cut the target by 1 percentage point
over the last four months of 2007 and by an additional 2¼ percentage points
over the first four months of 2008. After the events of September, it cut the
target in three additional steps in October and December, bringing it to its
current level of 0 to ¼ percent.
Conventional interest rate policy, however, could do little to deal
with the enormous disruptions to credit markets. As a result, the Federal
Reserve has used a range of unconventional tools to address those disruptions directly. For example, in March 2008, it created the Primary Dealer
Credit Facility and the Term Securities Lending Facility to provide liquidity
support for primary dealers (that is, financial institutions that trade directly
with the Federal Reserve) and the key financial markets in which they
operate. In October 2008, when the critical market for commercial paper
threatened to stop functioning, the Federal Reserve responded by setting up
the Commercial Paper Funding Facility to backstop the market.
Once the Federal Reserve’s target for the funds rate was effectively
lowered to zero in December 2008, there was another reason to use unconventional tools. Nominal interest rates generally cannot fall below zero:
because holding currency guarantees a nominal return of zero, no one is
willing to make loans at a negative nominal interest rate. As a result, when
the Federal funds rate is zero, supplying more reserves does not drive it
lower. Statistical estimates suggest that based on the Federal Reserve’s usual
response to inflation and unemployment, the subdued level of inflation and
the weak state of the economy would have led the central bank to reduce its
target for the funds rate by about an additional 5 percentage points if it could
have (Rudebusch 2009).
This desire to provide further stimulus, coupled with the inability to
use conventional interest rate policy, led the Federal Reserve to undertake
large-scale asset purchases to reduce long-term interest rates. In March
Rescuing the Economy from the Great Recession  |  47

2009, the Federal Reserve announced plans to purchase up to $300 billion of
long-term Treasury debt; it also announced plans to increase its purchases
of the debt of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks
(the government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, that support the mortgage
market) to up to $200 billion, and its purchases of agency (that is, Fannie
Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae) mortgage-backed securities to up to
$1.25 trillion.
Finally, the Federal Reserve has attempted to manage expectations by
providing information about its goals and the likely path of policy. Officials
have consistently stressed their commitment to ensuring that inflation
neither falls substantially below nor rises substantially above its usual level.
In addition, the Federal Reserve has repeatedly stated that economic conditions “are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the Federal funds
rate for an extended period.” To the extent this statement provides market
participants with information they did not already have, it is likely to keep
longer-term interest rates lower than they otherwise would be.
One effect of the Federal Reserve’s unconventional policies has been
an enormous expansion of the quantity of assets on the Federal Reserve’s
balance sheet. Figure 2-4 shows the evolution of Federal Reserve asset holdings since the beginning of 2007. One can see both that asset holdings nearly
tripled between January and December 2008 and that there was a dramatic
move away from short-term Treasury securities.

The flip side of the large increase in the Federal Reserve’s asset
holdings is a large increase in the quantity of reserves it has supplied to the
financial system. Some observers have expressed concern that the large
expansion in reserves could lead to inflation. In this regard, two key points
should be kept in mind. First, as already described, most statistical models
suggest that the Federal Reserve’s target interest rate would be substantially lower than it is today if it were not constrained by the fact that the
Federal funds rate cannot fall below zero. As a result, monetary policy is
in fact unusually tight given the state of the economy, not unusually loose.
Second, the Federal Reserve has the tools it needs to prevent the reserves
from leading to inflation. It can drain the reserves from the financial system
through sales of the assets it has acquired or other actions. Indeed, despite
the weak state of the economy, the return of credit market conditions toward
normal is leading to the natural unwinding of some of the exceptional credit
market programs. Another reliable way the Federal Reserve can keep the
reserves from creating inflationary pressure is by using its relatively new
ability to raise the interest rate it pays on reserves: banks will be unwilling
to lend the reserves at low interest rates if they can obtain a higher return on
their balances held at the Federal Reserve.

Financial Rescue
Efforts to stabilize the financial system have been a central part of
the policy response. As just discussed, even before the financial crisis in
September 2008, the Federal Reserve was taking steps to ease pressures
on credit markets. The events of the fall led to even stronger actions. On
September 7, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed in conservatorship under the Federal Housing Finance Agency to prevent a potentially
severe disruption of mortgage lending. On September 16, concern about
the potentially catastrophic effects of a disorderly failure of American
International Group (AIG) caused the Federal Reserve to extend the firm an
$85 billion line of credit. On September 19, concerns about the possibility
of runs on money-market mutual funds led the Treasury to announce a
temporary guarantee program for these funds.
On October 3, Congress passed and President Bush signed the
Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. This Act provided up
to $700 billion for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) for the
purchase of distressed assets and for capital injections into financial institutions, although the second $350 billion required presidential notification
to Congress and could be disallowed by a vote of both houses. The initial
$350 billion was used mainly to purchase preferred equity shares in financial institutions, thereby providing the institutions with more capital to help
them withstand the crisis.
Rescuing the Economy from the Great Recession  |  49

At President-Elect Obama’s request, President Bush notified Congress
on January 12, 2009 of his plan to release the second $350 billion of TARP
funds. With strong support from the incoming Administration, the Senate
defeated a resolution disapproving the release. These funds provided policymakers with critical resources needed to ensure financial stability.
On February 10, 2009, Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner
announced the Administration’s Financial Stability Plan. The plan represented a new, comprehensive approach to the financial rescue that sought
to tackle the interlocking sources of instability and increase credit flows.
An overarching theme was a focus on transparency and accountability to
rebuild confidence in financial markets and protect taxpayer resources.
A key element of the plan was the Supervisory Capital Assessment
Program (or “stress test”). The purpose was to assess the capital needs of
the country’s 19 largest financial institutions should economic and financial conditions deteriorate further. Institutions that were found to need an
additional capital buffer would be encouraged to raise private capital and
would be provided with temporary government capital if those efforts did
not succeed. This program was intended not just to examine the capital
positions of the institutions and ensure that they obtained more capital if
needed, but also to strengthen private investors’ confidence in the soundness
of the institutions’ balance sheets, and so strengthen the institutions’ ability
to obtain private capital.
Another element of the plan was the Consumer and Business Lending
Initiative, which was aimed at maintaining the flow of credit. In November
2008, the Federal Reserve had created the Term Asset-Backed Securities
Loan Facility to help counteract the dramatic decline in securitized lending.
In the February announcement of the Financial Stability Plan, the Treasury
greatly expanded the resources of the not-yet-implemented facility. The
Treasury increased its commitment to $100 billion to leverage up to $1 trillion of lending for businesses and households. By facilitating securitization,
the program was designed to help unfreeze credit and lower interest rates
for auto loans, credit card loans, student loans, and small business loans
guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA).
A third element of the plan was a Treasury partnership with the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve to create
the Public-Private Investment Program. A central purpose was to remove
troubled assets from the balance sheets of financial institutions, thereby
reducing uncertainty about their financial strength and increasing their
ability to raise capital and hence their willingness to lend. Partnership with
the private sector served two important objectives: it leveraged scarce public
funds, and it used private competition and incentives to ensure that the
government did not overpay for assets.
50  |  Chapter 2

There were two other key components of the Financial Stability Plan.
One was a wide-ranging program to reduce mortgage interest rates and help
responsible homeowners stay in their homes. These policies are described
later in the section on housing policy. The other component was a range
of measures to help small businesses. Many of these were included in the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and are discussed in the section on
fiscal stimulus.
Failure of the two troubled domestic automakers (GM and Chrysler)
threatened economy-wide repercussions that would have been magnified
by related problems at the automakers’ associated financial institutions
(GMAC and Chrysler Financial). To avoid these consequences, the Bush
Administration set up the Auto Industry Financing Program within the
TARP. This program extended $17.4 billion in funding to the two companies in late December 2008 and early January 2009. The program also
extended $7.5 billion in funding to the two auto finance companies around
the same time. Upon taking office, the Obama Administration required
the automakers to submit plans for restructuring and a return to viability
before additional funds were committed. To sustain the industry during
this planning process, the Treasury established the Warranty Commitment
Program to reassure consumers that warranties of the troubled firms would
be honored. It also initiated the Auto Supplier Support Program to maintain
stability in the auto supply base.
Over the spring of 2009, the Administration’s Auto Task Force
worked with GM and Chrysler to produce plans for viability. In the case
of Chrysler, the task force determined that viability could be achieved by
merging with the Italian automaker Fiat. For GM, the task force determined
that substantial reductions in costs were necessary and charged the company
with producing a more aggressive restructuring plan. For both companies, a
quick, targeted bankruptcy was judged to be the most efficient and successful
way to restructure. Chrysler filed for bankruptcy on April 30, 2009; GM, on
June 1. In addition to concessions by all stakeholders, including workers,
retirees, creditors, and suppliers, the U.S. Government invested substantial
funds to bring about the orderly restructuring. In all, more than $80 billion
of TARP funds had been authorized for the motor vehicle industry as of
September 20, 2009.

Fiscal Stimulus
The signature element of the Administration’s policy response to the
crisis was the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA).
The President signed the Recovery Act in Denver on February 17, just
28 days after taking office. At an estimated cost of $787 billion, the Act is
Rescuing the Economy from the Great Recession  |  51

the largest countercyclical fiscal action in American history. It provides tax
cuts and increases in government spending equivalent to roughly 2 percent
of GDP in 2009 and 2¼ percent of GDP in 2010. To put those figures in
perspective, the largest expansionary swing in the budget during Franklin
Roosevelt’s New Deal was an increase in the deficit of about 1½ percent of
GDP in fiscal 1936. That expansion, however, was counteracted the very
next fiscal year by a contraction that was even larger.
The fiscal stimulus was designed to fill part of the shortfall in
aggregate demand caused by the collapse of private demand and the Federal
Reserve’s inability to lower short-term interest rates further. It was part
of a comprehensive package that included stabilizing the financial system,
helping responsible homeowners avoid foreclosure, and aiding small businesses through tax relief and increased lending. The President set as a goal
for the fiscal stimulus that it raise employment by 3½ million relative to what
it otherwise would have been.
Several principles guided the design of the stimulus. One was that
it be spread over two years, reflecting the Administration’s view that the
economy would need substantial support for more than one year. At the
same time, the Administration also strongly supported keeping the stimulus
explicitly temporary. It was not to be an excuse to permanently expand the
size of government.
A second key principle was that the stimulus be well diversified.
Different types of stimulus affect the economy in different ways. Individual
tax cuts, for example, affect production and employment in a wide range of
industries by encouraging households to spend more on consumer goods,
while government investments in infrastructure directly increase construction activity and employment. In addition, underlying economic conditions
affect the efficacy of fiscal policy in ways that can be quantitatively important
and sometimes difficult to forecast. Likewise, different types of stimulus
affect the economy with different speeds. For instance, aid to individuals
directly affected by the recession tends to be spent relatively quickly, while
new investment projects require more time. Because of the need to provide
broad support to the economy over an extended period, the Administration
supported a stimulus plan that included a broad range of fiscal actions.
A third principle was that emergency spending should aim to address
long-term needs. Some spending, such as unemployment insurance, is
aimed at helping those directly affected by the recession maintain a decent
standard of living. But government investment spending should aim to
create enduring capital investments that increase productivity and growth.
The Recovery Act reflected those guiding principles. The Congressional
Budget Office (CBO) estimated that almost one-quarter of the stimulus
52  |  Chapter 2

would be spent by the end of the third quarter of 2009, and an additional half
would be spent over the next four quarters (Congressional Budget Office
2009b). So far, the pace of the spending and tax cuts has largely matched
CBO’s estimates.
The final package was very well diversified. Roughly one-third took
the form of tax cuts. The most significant of these was the Making Work
Pay tax credit, which cut taxes for 95 percent of working families. Taxes for
a typical family were reduced by $800 per couple for each of 2009 and 2010.
Another provision of the bill provided roughly $14 billion for one-time
payments of $250 to seniors, veterans, and people with disabilities. The
macroeconomic effects of these payments are likely to be similar to those
of tax cuts.
Businesses received important tax cuts as well. The most important
of these was an extension of bonus depreciation, which reduced taxes on
new investments by allowing firms to immediately deduct half the cost of
property and equipment purchases. One advantage of such temporary
investment incentives is that they can affect the timing of investment,
moving some investment from future years when the economy does not
have a deficiency of aggregate demand to the present, when it does.
In addition, because the financial market disruptions had a
particularly paralyzing effect on the financial plans of small businesses,
the Act included additional measures targeted specifically at those businesses. Tax cuts for small businesses included an expansion of provisions
allowing for the carryback of net operating losses, a temporary 75 percent
exclusion from capital gains taxes on small business stock, and the ability
to immediately expense up to $250,000 of qualified investment purchases.
In addition to reducing taxes, these provisions improve cash flow at firms
facing credit constraints and provide extra incentives for individuals to
invest in small businesses. The Act also included measures to help increase
small business lending through the SBA. In particular, it raised to 90
percent the maximum guarantee on SBA general purpose and working
capital loans (the 7(a) program) and eliminated fees on both 7(a) loans
and loans for fixed-asset capital and real estate investment projects (the
504 program).
Another important part of the stimulus consisted of fiscal relief to state
governments. Because almost every state has a balanced-budget requirement, the declines in revenues caused by the recession forced states to cut
spending or raise taxes, thereby further contracting demand and magnifying
the downturn. Federal fiscal relief can help prevent these contractionary
responses, helping to maintain critical state services and state employment,
prevent tax increases on families already suffering from the recession, and
Rescuing the Economy from the Great Recession  |  53

cushion the fall in demand. And because many states were already raising
taxes and cutting spending when the ARRA was passed, the effects were
likely to occur relatively quickly. The Act therefore included roughly $140
billion of state fiscal relief.
The Recovery Act also included approximately $90 billion of support
for individuals directly affected by the recession. This support serves two
critical purposes. First, it provides relief from the recession’s devastating
impact on families and individuals. Second, because the recipients typically
spend this support quickly, it provides an immediate boost to the broader
economy. Among the major components of this relief were an extension
and expansion of unemployment insurance benefits, subsidies to help the
unemployed continue to obtain health insurance, and additional funding
for the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. The Act also reduced
taxes on unemployment insurance benefits, the effect of which is similar to
an expansion of benefits.
Finally, the Recovery Act included direct government investment
spending. Because government investment raises output in the short run
both through its direct effects and by increasing the incomes and spending
of the workers employed on the projects, its output effects are particularly
large. In addition, because this type of stimulus is spent less quickly than
other types, it will play a vital role in providing support to the economy
after 2009. And by funding critical investments, this spending will raise the
economy’s output even in the long run.
The Act included funding both for traditional government investment
projects, such as transportation infrastructure and basic scientific research,
and for initial investments to jump-start private investment in emerging
new areas, such as health information technology, a smart electrical grid,
and clean energy technologies. The Act also included tax credits for specific
types of private spending, such as home weatherization and advanced energy
manufacturing, which are likely to have effects similar to direct government
investment spending. Altogether, roughly one-third of the budget impact
of the Recovery Act will take the form of these investments and tax credits.
Fiscal stimulus actions did not end with the passage and implementation of the Recovery Act. In June 2009, the Administration worked with
Congress to set up the Car Allowance Rebate System (CARS). Commonly
known as the “Cash for Clunkers” program, CARS gave rebates of up
to $4,500 to consumers who replaced older cars and trucks with newer,
more fuel-efficient models. The program was in effect for July and most
of August. After the program’s popularity led to quick exhaustion of the
original funding of $1 billion, the funding was increased to $3 billion to
allow more consumers to participate.
54  |  Chapter 2

In November, the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance
Act of 2009 cut taxes for struggling businesses and strengthened the safety net
for workers. In particular, the Act extended the net operating loss provisions
of the Recovery Act that allowed small businesses to count their losses this
year against taxes paid in previous years for an additional year, and expanded
the benefit to medium and large businesses. The Act also provided up to
20 additional weeks of unemployment insurance benefits for workers who
were reaching the end of their emergency unemployment benefits. In
December, an amendment to the Department of Defense Appropriations
Act of 2010 continued through the end of February 2010 the unemployment
insurance provisions of the Recovery Act, the November extension of emergency benefits, and the COBRA subsidy program that helps unemployed
workers maintain their health insurance. It also expanded the COBRA
premium subsidy period from 9 to 15 months and extended the increased
guarantees and fee waivers for SBA loans.

Housing Policy
The economic and financial crisis began in the housing market, and
an important part of the policy response has been directed at that market.
The Administration initiated the Making Home Affordable program
(MHA) in March 2009. This program was designed to support low mortgage rates, keep millions of homeowners in their homes, and stabilize the
housing market.
As described earlier, the Federal Reserve undertook large-scale
purchases of GSE debt and mortgage-backed securities in an effort to reduce
mortgage interest rates. At the same time, the Treasury Department made
an increased funding commitment to the GSEs. This increased government
support for the agencies also reduced their borrowing costs and so helped
lower mortgage interest rates.
Importantly, MHA also included a program to help households
take advantage of lower interest rates. The Home Affordable Refinance
Program helps families whose homes have lost value and whose mortgage
payments can be reduced by refinancing at historically low interest rates.
This program expanded the opportunity to refinance to borrowers with
loans owned or guaranteed by the GSEs who had a mortgage balance up to
125 percent of their home’s current value.
Another key component of MHA is the Home Affordable Modification
Program (HAMP), which is providing up to $75 billion to encourage loan
modifications. It offers incentives to investors, lenders, servicers, and
homeowners to encourage mortgage modifications in which all stakeholders
share in the cost of ensuring that responsible homeowners can afford their
Rescuing the Economy from the Great Recession  |  55

monthly mortgage payments. To protect taxpayers, HAMP focuses on
sound modifications. No payments are made by the government unless
the modification lasts for at least three months, and all the payments are
designed around the principle of “pay for success.” All parties have aligned
incentives under the program to achieve successful modifications at an
affordable and sustainable level.
The Administration has supported additional programs to help the
housing sector. The Recovery Act included an $8,000 first-time homebuyer’s
credit for home purchases made before December 1, 2009. As with temporary investment incentives, this credit can help the economy by changing
the timing of decisions, bringing buyers into the housing market who were
not planning on becoming homeowners until after 2009 or were postponing
their purchases in light of the distress in the market. In November, this
credit was expanded and extended by the Workers, Homeownership, and
Business Assistance Act of 2009.
The Recovery Act also gave considerable resources to the Neighborhood
Stabilization Program, a program administered by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development to stabilize communities that have
suffered from foreclosures and abandoned homes. The Administration also
provided assistance to state and local housing finance agencies and their
efforts to aid distressed homeowners, stimulate first-time home buying, and
provide affordable rental homes. These agencies had faced a significant
liquidity crisis resulting from disruptions in financial markets.

The Effects of the Policies
The condition of the American economy has changed dramatically in
the past year. At the beginning of 2009, financial markets were functioning
poorly, house prices were plummeting, and output and employment were
in freefall. Today, financial markets have stabilized and credit is starting to
flow again, house prices have leveled off, output is growing, and the employment situation is stabilizing. Because of the depth of the economy’s fall, we
are a long way from full recovery, and significant challenges remain. But the
trajectory of the economy is vastly improved.
There is strong evidence that the policy response has been central
to this turnaround. The actions to stabilize credit markets have prevented
further destructive failures of major financial institutions and helped maintain lending in key areas. The housing and mortgage policies have kept
hundreds of thousands of homeowners in their homes and brought mortgage rates to historic lows. The speed of the economy’s change in direction
has been remarkable and matches up well with the timing of the fiscal

56  |  Chapter 2

stimulus. And both direct estimates as well as the assessments of expert
observers underscore the crucial role played by the stimulus.

The Financial Sector
Given the powerful impact of the financial sector on the real economy,
a necessary first step to recovery of the real economy was recovery of the
financial sector. And the financial sector has unquestionably begun to
recover. Figure 2-5 extends the graph of the TED spread and the BAA-AAA
spread shown in Figure 2-3 through December 2009. After spiking to
unprecedented levels in October 2008, the TED spread fell rapidly over
the next two months but remained substantially elevated at the beginning
of 2009. It then declined gradually through August and is now at normal
levels. This key indicator of the basic functioning of credit markets suggests
substantial financial recovery. The BAA-AAA spread remained very high
through April but then fell rapidly from April to September. This spread,
which normally rises when the economy is weak because of higher corporate default risks, is now at levels comparable to those at the beginning of
the recession and below its levels in much of 1990–91 and 2002–03. Thus,
the current level of the spread appears to reflect mainly the weak state of the
economy rather than any specific difficulties in credit markets.

Rescuing the Economy from the Great Recession  |  57

Another broad indicator of the health of the financial system is the
level of stock prices, which depend both on investors’ expectations of future
earnings and on their willingness to bear risk. Figure 2-6 shows the behavior
of the S&P 500 stock price index since January 2006. This series declined by
18 percent from its peak in October 2007 through the end of August 2008,
fell precipitously in September, and continued to fall through March 2009
as the economy deteriorated sharply and investors became extremely fearful.
The stabilization of the economy and the restoration of more normal workings of financial markets have led to a sharp turnaround in stock prices. As
of December 31, 2009, the S&P 500 was 65 percent above its low in March.
As with the BAA-AAA spread, the current level of stock prices relative
to their pre-recession level appears to reflect the weaker situation of the
real economy rather than any specific problems with financial markets or
investors’ willingness to bear risk.

These indicators show that financial markets have evolved toward
normalcy, which was a necessary step in stopping the economic freefall. But
for the economy to recover fully, that is not enough: credit must be available to sound borrowers. On this front, the results are more mixed. Some
sources of credit are coming back strongly, but others remain weak.
As described in more detail later, one critical market where policies
have succeeded in lowering interest rates and maintaining credit flows is
58  |  Chapter 2

the mortgage market. Another market that has recovered substantially is
the market for commercial paper. In late 2008 and early 2009, this market
was functioning in large part because of the direct intervention of the
Federal Reserve. By mid-January, the Federal Reserve’s Commercial Paper
Funding Facility (CPFF) was holding $350 billion of commercial paper. As
credit conditions have stabilized, however, firms have been able to place
their commercial paper privately on better terms than through the CPFF,
and levels of commercial paper outstanding have remained stable even
as the Federal Reserve has reduced its holdings to less than $15 billion.
Nonetheless, quantities of commercial paper outstanding remain well below
their pre-crisis levels.
Another crucial source of credit that has stabilized is the market for
corporate bonds. As risk spreads have fallen, corporations have found it
easier to obtain funding by issuing longer-term bonds than by issuing such
instruments as commercial paper. As a result, corporate bond issuance, which
fell sharply in the second half of 2008, is now running above pre-crisis levels.
An important financial market development occurred in response to
the stress test conducted in the spring. This comprehensive review of the
soundness of the Nation’s 19 largest financial institutions, together with the
public release of this information, strengthened private investors’ confidence in the institutions. Partly as a result, the institutions were able to raise
$55 billion in private common equity, improving their capital positions and
their ability to lend.
The fact that financial institutions are increasingly able to raise private
capital is reducing their need to rely on public capital. Only $7 billion of
TARP funds have been extended to banks since January 20, 2009. Many
financial institutions have repaid their TARP funds, and the expected cost
of the program to the government has been revised down by approximately
$200 billion since August 2009.
Policy initiatives have also had a clear impact on small business
lending. Figure 2-7 shows the amount of SBA-guaranteed loans that have
been made since October 2006. SBA loan volume experienced its first
significant decrease in September and October 2007; following the failure of
Lehman Brothers in September 2008, it fell by more than half. The recovery
in small business lending coincided with the passage of the Recovery Act
in February 2009. In the months between Lehman’s fall and passage of
the Recovery Act, average monthly loan volume was $830 million; immediately after passage, loan volume began to steadily recover and averaged
$1.3 billion per month through September 2009. In September, loan
volume reached $1.9 billion, which was the highest level since August 2007;
this has since been exceeded by November 2009’s monthly loan volume of

$2.2 billion. In total, between February and December 2009 the SBA
guaranteed nearly $15 billion in small business lending.
Nonetheless, overall credit conditions have not returned to normal.
Many small business owners report continued difficulties in obtaining
credit. In addition, the severity of the downturn is leading to elevated rates
of failure of small banks, potentially disrupting their lending to small businesses and households. The market for asset-backed securities is also far
from fully recovered. As a result, it is often hard for banks and other lenders
to package and sell their loans, which forces them to hold a greater fraction
of the loans they originate and thus limits their ability to lend.
One important source of data on credit availability is the Federal
Reserve’s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices.
The survey, conducted every three months, examines whether banks
are tightening lending standards, loosening them, or keeping them basically unchanged. The October 2008 survey found that the overwhelming
majority of banks were tightening standards. This fraction has declined
steadily, and by October 2009 less than 20 percent were reporting that they
were tightening standards for commercial and industrial loans, though none
reported loosening standards. Thus, credit conditions remain tight.

Housing
As described earlier, policymakers have taken unprecedented actions
to maintain mortgage lending. One result has been a major shift in the
60  |  Chapter 2

composition of mortgage finance. In 2006, private institutions provided
60 percent of liquidity while the GSEs, the Federal Housing Agency (FHA),
and the Veterans Administration (VA) provided the remaining 40 percent.
As home prices began to decline nationally in 2007, private financing for
mortgages began to dry up. As of November 2009, the mortgages guaranteed by the GSEs, FHA, and the VA accounted for nearly all mortgage
originations. About 22 percent of mortgage originations are guaranteed
by FHA or VA, up from less than 3 percent in 2006. About 75 percent
of mortgage originations are guaranteed by the GSEs, up from less than
40 percent in 2006.
As Figure 2-8 shows, mortgage rates fell to historic lows in 2009—
consistent with the government’s increased funding commitment to Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac and the Federal Reserve’s purchases of mortgagebacked securities. These low mortgage rates support home prices and thus
benefit all homeowners. More directly, households that have refinanced
their mortgages at the lower rates have obtained considerable savings. These
savings have effects similar to tax cuts, improving households’ financial
positions and encouraging spending on other goods. With the help of the
Home Affordable Refinance Program, approximately 3 million borrowers
have refinanced, putting more than $6 billion of purchasing power at an
annual rate into the hands of households.

In addition, the Home Affordable Modification Program has been
successful in encouraging mortgage modifications. When the program was
launched, the Administration estimated that it could offer help to as many
as 3 million to 4 million borrowers through the end of 2012. On October
8, 2009, the Administration announced that servicers had begun more than
500,000 trial modifications, nearly a month ahead of the original goal. As
of November, the monthly pace of trial modifications exceeded the monthly
pace of completed foreclosures. Of course, not all trial modifications will
become permanent, but the Administration is making every effort to ensure
that as many sound modifications as possible do.
One important result of the policies aimed at the housing market
and of the broader policies to support the economy is that the housing
market appears to have stabilized. National home price indexes have
been relatively steady for the past several months, as shown in Figure 2-9.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency purchase-only house price index,
which is constructed using only conforming mortgages (that is, mortgages
eligible for purchase by the GSEs), has changed little since late 2008. The
LoanPerformance house price index, another closely watched measure that
uses conforming and nonconforming mortgages with coverage of repeat
sales transactions for more than 85 percent of the population, rose 6 percent
between March and August 2009 before declining slightly in recent months.
In addition, the pace of sales of existing single-family homes has increased
substantially. Sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 were 29 percent above
their low in the first quarter of 2009 and comparable to levels in the first half
of 2007.
Finally, there are signs of renewed building activity. After falling
81 percent from their peak in September 2005 to their low in January 2009,
single-family housing permits (a leading indicator of housing construction) rose 49 percent through December 2009. Similarly, after falling for
14 consecutive quarters, the residential investment component of real GDP
rose in the third and fourth quarters of 2009.
Inventories of vacant homes for sale remain at high levels, and many
vacant homes are being held off the market and will likely be put up for
sale as home prices increase. This overhang may lead to some additional
price declines, although prices are unlikely to fall at the same rate as they
did during the crisis. Thus, the recovery of the housing sector is likely to be
slow. Of course, we should neither expect nor want the housing market to
return to its pre-crisis condition. In the long run, as discussed in more detail
in Chapter 4, neither the extraordinarily high levels of housing construction
and price appreciation before the crisis nor the extraordinarily low levels of
construction and the rapid price declines during the crisis are sustainable.

Overall Economic Activity
The direction of overall economic activity changed dramatically over
the course of 2009. Figure 2-10 shows the quarterly growth rate of real GDP,
the broadest indicator of national production. After falling at an annual
rate of 6.4 percent in the first quarter, real GDP declined at a rate of just
0.7 percent in the second quarter. It then grew at a 2.2 percent rate in the
third quarter and a 5.7 percent rate in the fourth. Such a rapid turnaround
in growth is remarkable. The improvement in growth of 8.6 percentage
points from the first quarter to the third quarter (that is, the swing from
growth at a -6.4 percent rate to growth at a 2.2 percent rate) was the largest
since 1983. Similarly, the three-quarter improvement from the first quarter
to the fourth of 12.1 percentage points was the largest since 1981, and the
second largest since 1958.
One limitation of these simple statistics is that they do not account
for the usual dynamics of the economy. A more sophisticated way to gauge
the extent of the change in the economy’s direction is to compare the path
the economy has followed with the predictions of a statistical model. There
are many ways to construct a baseline statistical forecast. The particular one
used here is a vector autoregression (or VAR) that includes the logarithms
of real GDP (in billions of chained 2005 dollars) and payroll employment (in
thousands, in the final month of the quarter), using four lags of each variable

and estimated over the period 1990:Q1–2007:Q4. Because the sample period
ends in the fourth quarter of 2007, the coefficient estimates used to construct
the forecast are not influenced by the current recession. Rather, they show
the normal joint short-run dynamics of real GDP and employment over an
extended period. GDP and employment are then forecast for the final three
quarters of 2009 using the estimated VAR and actual data through the first
quarter of the year. The resulting comparison of the actual and projected
paths of the economy shows the differences between the economy’s actual
performance and what one would have expected given the situation as of
the first quarter and the economy’s usual dynamics.1 Although the results
presented here are based on one specific approach to constructing the
baseline projection, other reasonable approaches have similar implications.
This more sophisticated exercise also finds that the economy’s
turnaround has been impressive. The statistical forecast based on the economy’s normal dynamics projects growth at a -3.3 percent rate in the second
quarter of 2009, -0.5 percent in the third, and 1.3 percent in the fourth. In
all three quarters, actual growth was substantially higher than the projection.
Figure 2-11 shows that as a result, the level of GDP exceeded the projected
level by an increasing margin: 0.7 percent in the second quarter, 1.4 percent
in the third quarter, and 2.5 percent in the fourth.

of Economic Advisers (2010).

The gap between the actual and projected paths of GDP provides a
rough way to estimate the effect of economic policy. The most obvious
sources of the differences are the unprecedented policy actions. However,
the gap reflects all unusual influences on GDP. For example, the rescue
actions taken in other countries (described in Chapter 3) could have played
a role in better American performance. At the same time, the continuing
stringency in credit markets is likely lowering output relative to its usual
cyclical patterns. Thus, while some factors work in the direction of causing
the comparison of the economy’s actual performance with its normal
behavior to overstate the contribution of economic policy actions, others
work in the opposite direction.
One way to estimate the specific impact of the Recovery Act is to
use estimates from economic models. Mainstream estimates of economic
multipliers for the effects of fiscal policy can be combined with figures on
the stimulus to date to estimate how much the stimulus has contributed to
growth. (For the financial and housing policies, this approach is not feasible,
because the policies are so unprecedented that no estimates of their effects
are readily available.) When this exercise is performed using the multipliers
employed by the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), which are based on
mainstream economic models, the results suggest a critical role for the fiscal
stimulus. They suggest that the Recovery Act contributed approximately 2.8
Rescuing the Economy from the Great Recession  |  65

percentage points to growth in the second quarter, 3.9 percentage points in
the third, and 1.8 percentage points in the fourth. As a result, this approach
suggests that the level of GDP in the fourth quarter was slightly more than
2 percent higher than it would have been in the absence of the stimulus.
Knowledgeable outside observers agree that the Recovery Act has
increased output substantially relative to what it otherwise would have been.
For example, in November 2009, CBO estimated that the Act had raised the
level of output in the third quarter by between 1.2 and 3.2 percent relative to
the no-stimulus baseline (Congressional Budget Office 2009a). Private forecasters also generally estimate that the Act has raised output substantially.
A final way to look for the effects of the rescue policies on GDP is in
the behavior of the components of GDP. Figure 2-12 shows the contribution of various components of GDP to overall GDP growth in each of the
four quarters of 2009. One area where policy’s role seems clear is in business
investment in equipment and software. A key source of the turnaround in
GDP is the change in this type of investment from a devastating 36 percent
annual rate of decline in the first quarter to a 13 percent rate of increase by
the fourth quarter. Two likely contributors to this change were the investment incentives in the Recovery Act and the many measures to stabilize the
financial system and maintain lending. Similarly, the housing and financial

market policies were surely important to the swing in the growth of residential investment from a 38 percent annual rate of decline in the first quarter
to increases in the third and fourth quarters.
Two other components showing evidence of the policies’ effects
are personal consumption expenditures and state and local government
purchases. The Making Work Pay tax credit and the aid to individuals
directly affected by the recession meant that households did not have to cut
their consumption spending as much as they otherwise would have, and
the Cash for Clunkers program provided important incentives for motor
vehicle purchases in the third quarter. Consumption was little changed in
the first two quarters of 2009 and then rose at a healthy 2.8 percent annual
rate in the third quarter—driven in considerable part by a 44 percent rate of
increase in purchases of motor vehicles and parts—and at a 2.0 percent rate
in the fourth quarter. And, despite the dire budgetary situations of state and
local governments, their purchases rose at the fastest pace in more than five
years in the second quarter and were basically stable in the third and fourth
quarters. This stability almost surely could not have occurred in the absence
of the fiscal relief to the states.
The figure also shows the large role of inventory investment in
magnifying macroeconomic fluctuations. When the economy goes into
a recession, firms want to cut their inventories. As a result, inventory
investment moves from its usual slightly positive level to sharply negative,
contributing to the fall in output. Then, as firms moderate their inventory
reductions, inventory investment rises—that is, becomes less negative—
contributing to the recovery of output.
Finally, the turnaround in the automobile industry has been
substantial. The Cash for Clunkers program appears to have generated
a sharp increase in demand for automobiles in July and August 2009
(Council of Economic Advisers 2009). Sales of light motor vehicles averaged
12.6 million units at an annual rate during these two months, up from
an annual rate of 9.6 million units in the second quarter. Although some
observers had hypothesized that the July and August sales boost would be
offset by a corresponding loss of sales in the months immediately following,
sales in September (9.2 million at an annual rate) roughly matched the
pace of sales in the first half of 2009, and sales subsequently rebounded to a
10.8 million unit annual pace in the fourth quarter. Employment in motor
vehicles and parts hit a low of 633,300 in June 2009 and has increased
modestly since then. In December 2009, employment was 655,200.
Both GM and Chrysler proceeded through bankruptcy in an efficient

experts thought would be possible. The companies are performing in line

with their restructuring plans, and in November 2009, GM announced its
intention to begin repaying the Federal Government earlier than originally
expected. It made a first payment of $1 billion in December.

The Labor Market
The ultimate goal of the economic stabilization and recovery
policies is to provide a job for every American who seeks one. The recession’s
impact on the labor market has been severe: employment in December 2009
was 7.2 million below its peak level two years earlier, and the unemployment rate was 10 percent. Moreover, although real GDP has begun to grow,
employment losses are continuing.
Nonetheless, there is clear evidence that the labor market is
stabilizing. Figure 2-13 shows the average monthly job loss by quarter since
2006. Average monthly job losses have moderated steadily, from a devastating 691,000 in the first quarter of 2009 to 428,000 in the second quarter,
199,000 in the third, and 69,000 in the fourth. The change in the average
monthly change in employment from the first quarter to the third was the
largest over any two-quarter period since 1980, and the change from the
first to the fourth quarter was the largest three-quarter change since 1946.
Given what we now know about the terrible rate of job loss over the winter, it
would have been very difficult for the labor market to stabilize more rapidly
than it has.

One can again use the VAR described earlier to obtain a more
refined estimate of how the behavior of employment has differed from its
usual pattern. This statistical procedure implies that given the economy’s
behavior through the first quarter of 2009 and its usual dynamics, one would
have expected job losses of about 597,000 per month in the second quarter,
513,000 in the third quarter, and 379,000 in the fourth. Thus, actual employment as of the middle of the second quarter (May) was approximately
300,000 higher than one would have projected given the normal behavior
of the economy; as of the middle of the third quarter (August), it was about
1.1 million higher; and as of the middle of the fourth quarter (November), it
was about 2.1 million higher. As with the behavior of GDP, the portion of this
difference that is attributable to the Recovery Act and other policies cannot
be isolated from the portion resulting from other factors. But again, the
difference could either understate or overstate the policies’ contributions.
As with GDP, economic models can be used to focus specifically on
the contributions of the Recovery Act. The results are shown in Figure
2-14. The CEA’s multiplier estimates suggest that the Act raised employment relative to what it otherwise would have been by about 400,000 in the
second quarter of 2009, 1.1 million in the third quarter, and 1.8 million in
the fourth quarter. Again, these estimates are similar to other assessments.
For example, CBO’s November report estimated that the Act had raised

employment in the third quarter by between 0.6 million and 1.6 million,
relative to what otherwise would have happened.
A more complete picture of the process of labor market healing can
be obtained by looking at labor market indicators beyond employment.
Table 2-1 shows some of the main margins along which labor market
recovery occurs. The margins are listed from left to right in the rough
order in which they tend to adjust coming out of a recession. One of
the first margins to respond is productivity—when demand begins to
recover or moderates relative to the previous rate of decline, firms initially
produce more with the same number of workers. Another early margin is
initial claims for unemployment insurance—fewer workers are laid off. A
somewhat later margin is the average workweek—firms start increasing
production by increasing hours. The usual next step is temporary help
employment—when firms decide to hire, they often begin with temporary
help. Eventually total employment responds. The unemployment rate
usually lags employment slightly because employment growth brings some
discouraged workers back into the labor force and because the labor force
naturally grows over time. The last item to adjust is usually the duration of
unemployment spells, as workers who have been unemployed for extended
periods finally find jobs.
The table shows that recovery from this recession is following the
typical pattern, with labor market repair evident along the margins that
typically respond early in a recovery. Productivity growth has surged
as GDP has begun to increase and employment has continued to fall.

Initial unemployment insurance claims, which rose precipitously earlier
in the recession, have begun to decline at an increasing rate. Likewise, the
workweek has gone from shortening to lengthening, albeit slowly. Temporary
help employment has changed from extreme declines to substantial increases.
So far, total employment has shown a greatly moderating decline but has not
yet risen. The pace of increase in the unemployment rate has slowed noticeably, but the unemployment rate has not yet fallen on a quarterly basis.
Finally, increases in the duration of unemployment have not yet begun to
moderate noticeably.
These data suggest that the labor market is beginning to move in
the right direction, but much work remains to be done. The country is
not yet seeing the substantial rises in total employment and declines in the
unemployment rate that are the ultimate hallmark of robust labor market
improvement. And, of course, even once all the indicators are moving
solidly in the right direction, the labor market will still have a long way to go
before it is fully recovered.
Signs of healing are also beginning to appear in the industrial
composition of the stabilization of the labor market. Figure 2-15 shows the
average monthly change in each of eight sectors in each of the four quarters
of 2009. As one would expect of the beginnings of a recovery from a severe

recession, the moderation in job losses has been particularly pronounced in
manufacturing and construction, two of the most cyclically sensitive sectors.
There has also been a sharp turnaround in professional business services,
driven largely by renewed employment growth in temporary help services.
One area where the Recovery Act appears to have had a direct impact
on employment is in state and local government. Despite the enormous
harm the recession has done to their budgets, employment in state and
local governments has fallen relatively little. Indeed, employment in
state and local government, particularly in public education, rose in the
fourth quarter.

The Challenges Ahead
The financial and economic rescue policies have helped avert an
economic calamity and brought about a sharp change in the economy’s
direction. Output has begun growing again, and employment appears
poised to do so as well. But even when the country has returned to a path
of steadily growing output and employment, the economy will be far from
fully recovered. Since the recession began in December 2007, 7.2 million
jobs have been lost. It will take many months of robust job creation to erase
that employment deficit. For this reason, it is important to explore policies
to speed recovery and spur job creation.

Deteriorating Forecasts
This jobs deficit is much larger than the vast majority of observers
anticipated at the end of 2008. This is not the result of a slow economic turnaround. On the contrary, as described above, the change in the economy’s
direction has been remarkably rapid given the economy’s condition in the
first quarter of 2009. Rather, the jobs deficit reflects two developments.
The first development is the unanticipated severity of the downturn in
the real economy in 2008 and early 2009. Table 2-2 shows consensus forecasts from November 2008 through February 2009, along with preliminary
and actual estimates of real GDP growth. The table shows that the magnitude of the fall in GDP in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter
of 2009—driven in part by the unexpectedly strong spread of the crisis to
the rest of the world—surprised most observers. The Blue Chip Consensus
released in mid-December 2008 projected fourth quarter growth would be
-4.1 percent and first quarter growth would be -2.4 percent. The actual
values turned out to be -5.4 percent and -6.4 percent. The Blue Chip forecast
released in mid-January also projected a substantially smaller decline in first
quarter real GDP than actually occurred.

Part of the difficulty in forecasting resulted from large data revisions.
The official GDP figures available at the end of January 2009 indicated that
real GDP had fallen by just 0.2 percent over the four quarters of 2008; revised
data now put the decline at 1.9 percent.
The Administration’s economic forecast made in January 2009 and
released with the fiscal 2010 budget, like the private forecasts, underestimated the speed of GDP decline in the first quarter. It also underestimated
average growth over the remaining three quarters of 2009. For the four
quarters of 2009, the Administration forecast overall growth of 0.3 percent;
the actual value, according to the latest available data, is 0.1 percent.
The second development accounting for the unexpectedly large
jobs deficit involves the behavior of the labor market given the behavior
of GDP. Table 2-2 also shows consensus forecasts for the unemployment
rate. These data indicate that as of December 2008, unemployment in the
fourth quarter of 2009 was forecast to be 8.1 percent, dramatically less than
the actual value of 10.0 percent. As of mid-January 2009, unemployment
was forecast to be 8.4 percent in the fourth quarter. In its forecast made in
Rescuing the Economy from the Great Recession  |  73

January 2009, the Administration unemployment forecast was similar to the
consensus forecast.
Some of the unanticipated rise in unemployment was the result of the
worse-than-expected GDP growth in 2008 and the beginning of 2009. CEA
analysis, however, also suggests that the normal relationship between GDP
and unemployment has fit poorly in the current recession. This relationship, termed Okun’s law after former CEA Chair Arthur Okun who first
identified it, suggests that a fall in GDP of 1 percent relative to its normal
trend path is associated with a rise in the unemployment rate of about
0.5 percentage point after four quarters. Figure 2-16 shows the scatter plot
of the four-quarter change in real GDP and the four-quarter change in the
unemployment rate. The figure shows that although the fit of Okun’s law
is usually good, the relationship has broken down somewhat during this
recession. The error was concentrated in 2009, when the unemployment
rate increased considerably faster than might have been expected given the
change in real GDP. CEA calculations suggest that as of the fourth quarter
of 2009, the unemployment rate was approximately 1.7 percentage points
higher than would have been expected given the behavior of real GDP since
the business cycle peak in the fourth quarter of 2007.
This unusual rise in the unemployment rate does not appear to
result from unusual behavior of the labor force. If anything, the labor force

appears to have contracted somewhat more than usual given the path of the
economy. Rather it reflects larger-than-typical falls in employment relative
to the decline in GDP. This behavior is consistent with the tremendous
increase in productivity during this episode, especially over the final three
quarters of 2009. Indeed, labor productivity rose at a 6.9 percent annual
rate in the second quarter and at an 8.1 percent rate in the third quarter;
if productivity rose by a similar amount in the fourth quarter, as seems
likely, the increase will have been one of the fastest over three quarters in
postwar history.

The Administration Forecast
Looking forward, the Administration projects steady but moderate
GDP growth over the near and medium term. Table 2-3 reports the
Administration’s forecast used in preparing the President’s fiscal year 2011
budget. The table shows that GDP growth in 2010 is forecast to be 3 percent.

Rescuing the Economy from the Great Recession  |  75

The Administration estimates that normal or potential GDP growth will be
roughly 2½ percent per year (see Box 2-1). Because projected GDP growth
is only slightly stronger than potential growth, relatively little decline is
projected in the unemployment rate during 2010. Indeed, it is possible that
the rate will rise for a while as some discouraged workers return to the labor
force, before starting to generally decline. Consistent with this, employment
growth is projected to be roughly equal to normal trend growth of about
100,000 per month.
Box 2-1: Potential Real GDP Growth
The Administration forecast is based on the idea that real GDP
fluctuates around a potential level that trends upward at a relatively steady
rate. Over the budget window, potential real GDP is projected to grow at
a 2.5 percent annual rate. Potential real GDP growth is a measure of the
sustainable rate of growth of productive capacity.
The growth rate of the economy over the long run is determined
by its supply side components, which include population, labor force
participation, the ratio of nonfarm business employment to household
employment, the length of the workweek, and labor productivity. The
Administration’s forecast for the contribution of the growth rates of
these supply side factors to potential real GDP growth is shown in the
accompanying table.

Box 2-1, continued
The normal or potential labor force participation rate, which fell at a
0.3  percent annual rate during the past 8 years, is expected to continue
declining at that pace. The continued projected decline results from the
aging baby boom generation entering their retirement years. The potential
employment rate (that is, 1 minus the normal or potential unemployment rate) is not expected to contribute to potential GDP growth because
no change is anticipated in the unemployment rate consistent with
stable inflation. The potential ratio of nonfarm business employment
to household employment is also expected to be flat during the forecast
horizon—consistent with its average behavior in the long run. This would
be a change, however, from its puzzling 0.5 percent annual rate of decline
during the past business cycle. The potential workweek is projected to
edge down slightly (0.1 percent per year). This is a slightly shallower pace
of decline than over the past 50 years, when it declined 0.3 percent per
year. Over the 11-year projection interval, some firming of the workweek
would be a natural labor market accommodation to the anticipated decline
in labor force participation.
Potential growth of labor productivity is projected at 2.3 percent per
year, a conservative forecast relative to its measured product-side growth
rate (2.8 percent) between the past two business cycle peaks, but close to
an alternative income-side measure of productivity growth (2.2 percent)
during the same period. The ratio of real GDP to nonfarm business output
is expected to continue to subtract from overall growth as it has over most
long periods, because the nonfarm business sector generally grows faster
than other sectors, such as government, households, and nonprofit institutions. Together, the sum of all of the components is the growth rate of
potential real GDP, which is 2.5 percent per year.
As Table 2-3 shows, actual real GDP is projected to grow more
rapidly than potential real GDP over most of the forecast horizon. The
most important reason for the difference is that the actual employment rate is projected to rise as millions of workers who are currently
unemployed return to employment and so contribute to GDP growth.

Traditionally, the large amount of slack would be expected to put
substantial downward pressure on wage and price inflation. For this reason,
inflation is projected to remain low in 2010. However, because inflationary
expectations remain well anchored, inflation is not likely to slow dramatically or become negative (that is, turn into deflation).

Rescuing the Economy from the Great Recession  |  77

In 2011, slightly higher GDP growth of approximately 4 percent
is projected (again measured from fourth quarter to fourth quarter).
Consistent with this, stronger employment growth and a more substantial
decline in the unemployment rate are expected in 2011. However, because
GDP growth is still not projected to be as robust as that following some
other deep recessions, continued large output gaps are anticipated. This will
limit the upward movement of the inflation rate toward a pace consistent
with the Federal Reserve’s long-term target inflation rate of about 2 percent.
Moreover, employment growth is unlikely to be large enough to reduce the
employment shortfall dramatically in 2011.

Responsible Policies to Spur Job Creation
This large employment gap and the prospects that it is likely to recede
only slowly make a compelling case for additional measures to spur private
sector job creation. The Administration is therefore exploring a range of
possibilities and working with Congress to pass measures into law.
Several principles are guiding this process. First, at a time when
the budget deficit is large and the country faces significant long-run fiscal
challenges, measures must be cost-effective. Second, given that the employment consequences of the recession have been severe, measures must focus
particularly on job creation. And third, measures must be tailored to the
state of the economy: the policies that are appropriate when an economy is
contracting rapidly may not be the same as those that are appropriate for an
economy that is growing again but operating below capacity.
Guided by these principles, the Administration has identified three key
priorities. One is a multifaceted program to jump-start job creation by small
businesses, which are critical to growth and have been particularly harmed
by the recession. Among the possible policies in this area are investment
incentives, tax incentives for hiring, and additional steps to increase the availability of loans backed by the Small Business Administration. These policies
may be particularly effective at a time when the economy is growing—so that
the question for many firms is not whether to hire but when—and at a time
when credit availability remains an important constraint.
Initiatives to encourage energy efficiency and clean energy are another
priority. One proposal involves incentives for homeowners to retrofit
their homes for energy efficiency. Because in many cases the effect of such
incentives would be to lead homeowners to make cost-saving investments
earlier than they otherwise would have, they might have an especially large
impact. In addition, the employment effects would be concentrated in
construction, an area that has been particularly hard-hit by the recession.

78  |  Chapter 2

The Administration has also supported extending tax credits through the
Department of Energy that promote the manufacture of advanced energy
products and providing incentives to increase the energy efficiency of public
and nonprofit buildings.
A third priority is infrastructure investment. The experience of the
Recovery Act suggests that spending on infrastructure is an effective way to
put people back to work while creating lasting investments that raise future
productivity. For this reason, the Administration is supporting an additional investment of up to $50 billion in roads, bridges, airports, transit, rail,
and water projects. Funneling some of these funds through programs such
as the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER)
program at the Department of Transportation, which is a competitive grant
program, could offer a way to ensure that the projects with the highest
returns receive top priority.
Finally, it is critical to maintain our support for the individuals and
families most affected by the recession by extending the emergency funding
for such programs as unemployment insurance and health insurance subsidies for the unemployed. This support not only cushions the worst effects of
the downturn, but also boosts spending and so spurs job creation. Similarly,
it is important to maintain support for state and local governments. The
budgets of these governments remain under severe strain, and many are
cutting back in anticipation of fiscal year 2011 deficits. Additional fiscal
support could therefore have a rapid impact on spending, and would do so
by maintaining crucial services and preventing harmful tax increases.

Conclusion
The recession that began at the end of 2007 became the “Great
Recession” following the financial crisis in the fall of 2008. In the wake of
the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September, American families faced
devastating job losses, high unemployment, scarce credit, and lost wealth.
Late 2008 and 2009 will be remembered as a time of great trial for American
workers, businesses, and families.
But 2009 should also be remembered as a year when even more tragic
losses and dislocation did not occur. As terrible as this recession has been,
a second Great Depression would have been far worse. Had policymakers
not responded as aggressively as they did to shore up the financial system,
maintain demand, and provide relief to those directly harmed by the
downturn, the outcome could have been much more dire.
As 2010 begins, there are strong signs that the American economy is
starting to recover. Housing and financial markets appear to have stabilized

Rescuing the Economy from the Great Recession  |  79

and real GDP is growing again. The labor market also appears to be healing,
showing the expected early pattern of response to output expansion.
With millions of Americans still unemployed, much work remains to
restore the American economy to health. It will take a prolonged and robust
GDP expansion to eliminate the large jobs deficit that has opened up over
the course of the recession. Only when the unemployment rate has returned
to normal levels and families are once again secure in their jobs, homes, and
savings will this terrible recession truly be over.

CRISIS AND RECOVERY
IN THE WORLD ECONOMY

T

he financial crisis and recession have affected economies around the
globe. The impact on the U.S. economy has been severe, but many areas
of the world have fared even worse. The average growth rate of real gross
domestic product (GDP) around the world was -6.2 percent at an annual
rate in the fourth quarter of 2008 and -7.5 percent in the first quarter of 2009.
All told, the world economy is expected to have contracted 1.1 percent in
2009 from the year before—the first annual decline in world output in more
than half a century.1 Although economic dislocations have been severe in
one region or another at various times over the past 50 years, never in that
time span has the annual output of the entire global economy contracted.
But, as bad as the outcome has been, the decline would likely have been far
larger if policymakers in the world’s key economies had not acted forcefully
to limit the impact of the crisis.
The global economic crisis started as a financial crisis, generally
beginning in housing-related asset markets, and accelerated in the fall of
2008. After September 2008, interbank interest rates spiked, exchange rates
shifted quickly, and the flows of capital across borders slowed dramatically.
Trade flows also plummeted, falling even more dramatically than GDP. As
a result, trade flows became a key transmission mechanism in the crisis,
spreading macroeconomic distress to countries that were not primarily
exposed to the financial shocks.
Policymakers around the world responded quickly, sometimes taking
coordinated action, sometimes acting independently. Many central banks

Quarterly figures are calculations of the Council of Economic Advisers based on a 64-country
sample that represents 93 percent of world GDP. Annual average projections are from the
International Monetary Fund (2009a). These projections indicate that from the fourth quarter
of 2007 to the fourth quarter of 2008, world GDP contracted 0.1 percent, and from the fourth
quarter of 2008 to the fourth quarter of 2009, world GDP expanded 0.8 percent. The contraction
was strongest from the middle of 2008 to the middle of 2009; hence the annual average growth
from 2008 to 2009 (-1.1 percent) is lower than the fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter numbers.

cut interest rates nearly to zero and expanded their balance sheets to try to
stimulate lending and keep their economies going. They also lent large sums
to one another to prevent dislocations caused by a lack of foreign currency
in some markets. Beyond the central bank actions, governments intervened
more broadly in banks and financial markets as well. Governments also
spent large sums in fiscal stimulus to avoid massive drop-offs in aggregate
demand. In a welcome development, they did not, however, restrict trade in
an attempt to turn away imports.
The global economy is now seeing the beginnings of recovery.
Financial markets have rebounded, trade is recovering, and GDP growth
rates are again positive. Recovery is far from complete or certain, and some
risks remain: lending is still constrained, and unemployment is painfully
high. But, at the start of 2010, the world economy is no longer at the edge of
collapse, and the elements of a sound recovery seem to be coming into place.

International Dimensions of the Crisis
The worldwide contraction had roots in many financial phenomena,
and its rapid spread can be seen in a number of financial indicators.
Borrowing costs increased, U.S. dollars were scarce in foreign markets,
and exchange rates moved rapidly. Yet, despite problems in U.S. financial
markets, there was no U.S. dollar crisis, and while currency markets moved
rapidly, many of the emerging-market currency depreciations were temporary and not accompanied by cascading defaults. Thus, the world economy
was better positioned for recovery than it might have been.

Spread of the Financial Shock
One of the early indicators of the crisis was the large spike in the
interest rate banks charge one another that took place as the value of assets
held on bank balance sheets came into question. After the investment bank
Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy in September 2008, banks grew even
warier about lending to each other. This fear of lending to one another can
be seen by comparing the interbank lending rate with the risk-free overnight interest rate. Similar to the TED spread, the Libor-OIS spread (the
London interbank offered rate minus the overnight indexed swap) gives
such a comparison for dollar loans, and comparable spreads are available
for loans in other currencies. As Figure 3-1 shows, the spike in spreads for
dollar loans was larger earlier, but the increase in interbank lending rates
was sharp in dollars, pounds, and euros alike. Banks simply refused to lend
to one another at low rates in these major financial systems. Furthermore,
concerns about which firms might go bankrupt sent the cost of insuring

against a default on a bond soaring. Thus, costs of borrowing increased
for even creditworthy borrowers, putting a strain on the ability of firms to
finance themselves.
The Dollar Shortage. Beyond the difficulties of evaluating counterparty risk were the acute shortages of dollar liquidity outside the United
States, which were reflected in a steep rise in the cost of exchanging foreign
currency for dollars for a fixed period of time (a foreign currency swap).
The reasons for the dollar shortage are complex but can be understood by
looking at foreign banks’ behavior before the crisis. During the boom years,
non-U.S. banks acquired large amounts of dollar-denominated assets, often
paying for these acquisitions with borrowed dollars rather than with their
own currency, thus avoiding the currency mismatch risk of borrowing in
one currency and having assets in another. Much of the dollar borrowing
was short term and came from U.S. money-market funds. After investors
began to pull their money out of these funds in the fall of 2008, that source of
lending dried up, and banks were left trying to obtain dollars in other ways.
This put pressure on the currency swap market.
Before the crisis, moreover, some banks funded purchases of U.S.
assets directly through swaps. In a simplified version of the transaction,
foreign banks borrow in their own currency (euros, for example), exchange
that currency for dollars through a swap, and then use the dollars to buy U.S.
assets. By using a swap market rather than simply purchasing currency, they

Crisis and Recovery in the World Economy  |  83

even out the currency risk (McGuire and von Peter 2009),2 but they are left
with a funding risk. If no one will lend them dollars when their swap is due,
they may have to sell their dollar assets (some of which may have fallen in
value) to pay back the dollars they owe. When banks became very nervous
about taking on risk, demand greatly increased the price of currency swaps.
Unwinding Carry Trades. As concerns about the stability of the
financial markets heightened over the course of 2008, investors responded
by trying to deleverage and reduce some of their exposed risky positions.
The desire to undo risky positions coupled with the dollar shortage led to
swift movements in currency markets, especially an unwinding of the “carry
trade.” In the carry trade, an investor borrows money in a low-interest-rate
currency (for example, the Japanese yen), sells that currency for a higherinterest-rate currency (for example, the Australian dollar), and invests the
money in that currency. If interest rates are 1 percent in Japan and 6 percent
in Australia, the investor stands to collect a 5 percent profit if exchange rates
do not move. Although economic theory suggests that currency movements
should offset this expected profit, over short horizons, if the exchange rate
does not move, investors can make a profit. This happened in the mid2000s, and the carry trade became a favorite strategy for hedge funds and
other investors.
The popularity of the trade became self-fulfilling as the continued
flows of money into higher-interest-rate currencies helped them appreciate
and made the trade even more profitable. But, as the crisis hit, investors
tried to reduce their risk and leverage. This unwinding process meant rapid
sales of high-interest-rate currencies and rapid purchases of low-interest-rate
currencies. Currencies that had low interest rates and had been known as
funding currencies (such as the Japanese yen) rose rapidly in value, and the
currencies of a number of popular carry-trade destinations (such as Australia,
Brazil, and Iceland) depreciated swiftly. Thus, as the crisis hit, borrowing
became more expensive and currency markets were increasingly volatile.
The Dollar During the Crisis. Although in many ways the crisis was
triggered within U.S. asset markets, the response was not a run on the U.S.
dollar; instead the dollar strengthened notably. Some observers had argued
that the high U.S. current account deficit and problems in the U.S. housing
and other asset markets might lead to an unwillingness to hold U.S. assets
more broadly, which could have triggered a depreciation of the dollar. But
both the need for foreign banks to cover their dollar borrowing and the
need for other investors to repay loans borrowed in dollars (including for
carry trades) generated strong demand for dollars. Further, the desire to

The swap means they have borrowed dollars and lent euros. In this way, they borrowed euros
at home and lent them in the swap, and they owe dollars in the swap but also own dollar assets.
Thus, their foreign currency position is balanced.

84  |  Chapter 3

avoid risky investments at the height of the crisis led to a “flight to safety,”
with many investors buying dollars and U.S. Treasury bills. As seen in
Figure 3-2, the trade-weighted value of the dollar increased 18 percent
from July 2008 to its peak in March 2009. The movement of the dollar was
broad-based, with sharp appreciations against most major trade partners;
the main exceptions were Japan, where the yen appreciated even more
against the world as the carry trade unwound, and China, which had reestablished its peg to the dollar in July of 2008 and therefore had a stable exchange
rate against the dollar.

Currency Volatility in Emerging Markets. The deleveraging and
fall in risk appetite contributed to large and in some cases sharp swings in
the currencies of many emerging economies, but the impact of these large
depreciations varied. Some of the sharpest depreciations, such as those in
Brazil, Korea, and Mexico, were largely temporary. The currencies of all
three countries depreciated more than 50 percent against the dollar between
the end of July 2008 and February 2009, but by the end of November 2009
Korea’s currency was down only 15 percent and Brazil’s only 12 percent.
Mexico was still 29 percent below its summer 2008 value.3
3

The starting point for comparison is important. Korea had been depreciating in early 2008 as
well, while Brazil and Mexico were appreciating. Thus, by the end of November 2009, Brazil had
appreciated slightly from the start of 2008 while Korea had depreciated 24 percent and Mexico
18 percent.

Crisis and Recovery in the World Economy  |  85

Some countries with large current account deficits faced more
pressure. The region with the sharpest declines in the value of its currencies
against the dollar was Eastern Europe, where the currencies of Hungary,
Poland, and Ukraine all depreciated more than 50 percent between July
2008 and February 2009, and others depreciated nearly as much. These large
depreciations resulted in part from the strengthening of the dollar against
the euro, as many of these countries are closely tied with Europe, but some
of these currencies remained weak even when other countries started to
strengthen against the dollar.
A large depreciation can especially lead to broad damage in an
economy if there are negative balance-sheet effects. In this setting, a
country may have few foreign assets but extensive liabilities denominated
in foreign currency. As the exchange rate depreciates, the foreign currency
loans become more expensive in local currency. This was particularly a
concern in Eastern Europe, where many countries borrowed substantially
in foreign currency leading up to the crisis. In Hungary, for example, many
individuals took out mortgages in foreign currency. The depreciation of the
Hungarian forint thus put pressure on both individuals and bank balance
sheets. There was widespread concern that the Western European banks,
such as those in Austria, that had made loans in Eastern Europe would face
substantial losses. Both the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned
of potentially serious bank problems in Austria because of these concerns.
By the end of 2009, however, those concerns had not materialized. Austria
has had to shore up its banks, but there has not been widespread contagion
from Eastern Europe.
During the peak of the crisis, the spreads on emerging-market bonds
spiked, but they returned toward more standard levels over time, and
outright financial collapse was avoided. There are a number of reasons
for the more contained impact of the exchange-rate movements during
the crisis. In the past decade, many developing countries have reduced the
currency mismatch on their balance sheets by borrowing less, increasing
their stocks of foreign exchange reserves, and shifting away from debt
finance (Lane and Shambaugh forthcoming). The improved fiscal positions
of some countries likely also helped, as did the strong policy response and
coordination described later. Some vulnerable countries also benefited from
the strengthening of the IMF’s lending capabilities (discussed later). The
failure of this shock to turn into a series of deep sustained financial collapses
across the emerging world was a welcome development that left the world
economy better positioned for a quick turnaround.

86  |  Chapter 3

The Collapse of World Trade
Despite this crisis’s origins in the financial sector, trade rapidly
became a crucial source of transmission of the crisis around the world.
Exports collapsed in nearly every major trading country, and total world
trade fell faster than it did during the Great Depression or any time since.
From a peak in July 2008 to the low in February 2009, the nominal value of
world goods exports fell 36 percent; the nominal value of U.S. goods exports
fell 28 percent (imports fell 38 percent) over the same period. Even countries such as Germany, which did not experience their own housing bubble,
experienced substantial trade contractions, which helped spread the crisis.
The collapse in net exports in Germany and Japan contributed substantially
to their declines in GDP, helping drive these countries into recession. In
the fourth quarter of 2008, Germany’s drop in net exports contributed
8.1 percentage points to a 9.4 percent decline in GDP (at an annual rate);
Japan’s net exports contributed 9.0 percentage points to a 10.2 percent GDP
decline. Real exports fell even faster in the first quarter of 2009.
Figure 3-3 shows that the drop in the trade-to-GDP ratio during this
crisis, from 28 percent to 23 percent in OECD countries, is unprecedented.
Trade as a share of GDP had not dropped by more than 2 percentage
points from the year before since at least 1970 (the earliest available data),
suggesting trade’s drop relative to GDP has been larger than in the past.
Economists have noted that the responsiveness of trade to GDP has been

rising over time. Three main reasons for the exceptionally large fall in
trade, even given the decline in GDP, have been suggested (Freund 2009;
Levchenko, Lewis, and Tesar 2009; and Baldwin 2009).
The first reason is the use of global supply chains (or vertical
specialization), where parts of production are manufactured or assembled
in different countries and intermediate inputs are shipped from country to
country, often from one branch of a firm to another, and then sent to a final
destination for finishing. In this case, a reduction in output of one car may
involve a decrease in shipments far larger than the final value of that single
car. For example, a country that imports $80 of inputs and adds $20 of
value added before exporting a $100 good will see GDP fall by $20 if demand
for that good disappears, but trade (measured as the average of imports
and exports) will fall $90. If the decline in demand was concentrated in
goods where global supply chains were particularly important, this could
help account for the large fall in trade-to-GDP ratios. Estimates are that
imported inputs account for, on average, 30 percent of the content of exports
in OECD and major emerging market countries, although there is variation
across countries within the OECD. Figure 3-4 shows that, with the exception of Ireland, the percentage by which trade declined for a country was

strongly correlated with the extent of that country’s vertical specialization
(specifically defined as the degree of imported inputs used in exports).
Second, the disruption in global financial markets may have helped
generate the trade collapse. Exporters typically require some form of
financing to produce their export goods because importers will not pay
for them before they arrive. Similarly, importers may need some sort of
financing to bridge the gap between when they need to pay for goods and
when they will be able to sell them on a domestic market. When liquidity
tightened in world financial markets, the cost of trade finance increased.
Little high-quality information is available for trade finance because it
is typically arranged by banks or from one party to another, rather than
through an organized exchange. The data that do exist show a drop in trade
finance, but one that is not necessarily larger than the drop in overall trade.
The drop in general financing available for producers and consumers, along
with the impact of the recession on aggregate demand, may be factors as
significant as the specifics of trade finance.4
Finally, the types of products that are traded may have been a critical
factor in the trade collapse. Investment goods and consumer durables make
up a substantial portion of merchandise trade, representing 57 percent of
U.S. exports and 49 percent of U.S. imports in 2006. In a recession, investment spending by firms and purchases of durable goods by consumers often
fall more sharply than other components of GDP. Because these investment
and purchasing decisions are large and irreversible, they may be delayed
until the economic situation is more clear. The drop in spending in these
categories during this crisis has been far more severe than in previous recessions in the past 30 years in the United States. Paralleling the movements in
overall demand, the collapse in the nominal value of trade was most severe
in capital and durable goods and in chemicals and metals, and least severe
in services and nondurable goods. The combination of the concentration
of the spending reduction in these sectors and the sectors’ importance in
overall trade appears to be one source of the sharp fall in trade in the crisis.

The Collapse in Financial Flows
Trade in goods was not the only international flow to collapse.
Financial trade evaporated in a way never before seen. U.S. outflows and
inflows of finance rose steadily for decades as increasingly integrated
capital markets grew in size and scope. By 2007, the average monthly gross
purchases and sales of foreign long-term assets by American investors were
4

See Mora and Powers (2009) for a discussion of trade finance in the recent crisis. Levchenko,
Lewis, and Tesar (2009) find no support for the notion that trade credit played a role in the
reduced trade flows for the United States during the crisis.

Crisis and Recovery in the World Economy  |  89

$1.4 trillion, and foreigners’ purchases and sales of U.S. long-term assets
were $4.9 trillion. Each group both bought and sold a considerable amount
of their holdings, so that net purchases by Americans were $19 billion a
month and net purchases by foreign investors were $84 billion a month.
When the crisis hit, there was a massive deglobalization of finance
that was unprecedented and in many ways more extreme than the collapse
in goods and services trade. Figure 3-5 shows that the scale of cross-border
flows was cut in half after years of fairly steady climbing. Net purchases by
both home and foreign investors actually became negative in the fall of 2008
(that is, there were more sales than purchases). Americans pulled funds
home at such a fast pace that from July to November of 2008, Americans on
net sold foreign assets worth $143 billion. Foreign investors also liquidated
their positions, selling a net $92 billion in U.S. holdings. Hence, outflows
from foreign investors returning to their home markets were offset in part
by inflows from Americans bringing money back to the United States, likely
reducing the impact of the outflows.

The Decline in Output Around the Globe
While the triggers of the crisis are generally considered financial in
nature, these shocks were rapidly transmitted to the real economy. What
had been a financial market shock or a trade collapse became a full-fledged
recession in countries around the world. The financial disruption was so
90  |  Chapter 3

strong and swift in most countries that confidence fell as well. Confidence
levels are measured in different ways across countries, but they were generally falling throughout 2008 and reached recent lows in the fall of 2008 and
winter of 2009. In many countries, confidence had not been so low in more
than a decade.
As noted, world GDP is estimated to have fallen roughly 1.1 percent
in 2009 from the year before. The number for the annual average masks
the shocking depth of the crisis in the winter of 2008–09, when GDP was
contracting at an annual rate over 6 percent. In advanced economies, the
crisis was even deeper; the IMF expects GDP to have contracted 3.4 percent
in advanced economies for all of 2009. For OECD member countries,
GDP fell at an annual rate of 7.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 and
8.4 percent in the first quarter of 2009. Despite the historic nature of its
collapse, the U.S. economy actually fared better than about half of OECD
economies during those quarters. Figure 3-6 shows the decline in industrial production across major economies, with each of these economies in
January 2009 more than 10 percent below its January 2008 level, and Japan
faring far worse relative to the other major economies.

Some emerging market countries collapsed as well, with contractions at an annual rate of over 20 percent in Mexico, Russia, and Turkey,
but the collapses were brief—lasting only a quarter or so. On average,
the emerging and developing world was quite resilient to the crisis and is

projected to have continued to expand in 2009 at a rate of 1.7 percent for
the year (these countries contracted in the first quarter, but they began
growing quickly in the second quarter). Some regions, such as developing
Asia, continued to grow at a robust pace for the year as a whole (over
6 percent), but even that rate is considerably slower than their growth in the
mid-2000s. Figure 3-7 shows that industrial production fell in Brazil and
Mexico in a manner similar to that in industrial economies, but in China
and India it merely stalled for a brief period and then accelerated again.
This overall performance in the emerging world is a turnaround from
previous crises, where recessions in the advanced countries were followed
by sustained collapses in some emerging countries.

The combination of weak aggregate demand and falling energy
prices has meant that price pressure has been starkly absent in this crisis.
In fact, lower oil prices have meant that year-over-year inflation numbers
were negative in most major countries until toward the end of 2009
(Figure 3-8). Core inflation rates—which exclude volatile energy and food
prices—have also been quite low over the year and even negative in Japan.
This lack of price pressure has left the world’s central banks with more
flexibility than they had in the 1970s recessions because they do not have
pressing inflation problems to consider. Inflation has also been muted in
emerging and developing countries relative to their history; it is estimated
92  |  Chapter 3

to be 5.5 percent over 2009 and is projected to fall slightly in 2010. As
economies and commodity markets strengthened toward the end of 2009,
inflation pressure grew in a limited number of countries but was not in any
way widespread.

Policy Responses Around the Globe
Given the severity of the downturn, it is not surprising that
policymakers responded with dramatic action. Central banks cut interest
rates, governments spent considerable sums in the form of fiscal stimulus,
and governments and central banks supported financial sectors with funds
and guarantees. Many of these actions were coordinated as policymakers
tried to prevent the financial market upheaval and recession from becoming
a full-fledged depression.

Monetary Policy in the Crisis
The response of monetary authorities was both strong and swift across
the globe. The major central banks coordinated a significant rate cut of
50 basis points on October 8, 2008, in an attempt to increase liquidity and
to boost confidence by demonstrating that they were prepared to act decisively. During the crisis, every member of the Group of Twenty (G-20)

Crisis and Recovery in the World Economy  |  93

major economies cut interest rates. By March 2009, the Federal Reserve,
the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of England had all cut rates to 0.5 percent
or less, with the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan approaching the
zero nominal lower bound. The European Central Bank (ECB) responded
slightly more slowly but still cut its policy rate more than 3 percentage
points to 1 percent by May 2009 (Figure 3-9). Emerging market countries
and major commodity exporters, whose economies were growing fast in the
summer of 2008, moved as well, but not to the near-zero levels seen at the
major central banks.

Besides cutting interest rates, three of the largest central banks used
nonstandard monetary policy as well. As Figure 3-10 shows, the Federal
Reserve and the Bank of England more than doubled the size of their balance
sheets in 2008 (see Chapter 2 for more details on the Federal Reserve’s
actions). The two banks bought large quantities of assets, substantially
increasing the supply of reserves, and made loans against a variety of asset
classes. The goal of these programs was to free up credit in markets that
were being underserved through purchases of, or loans against, asset-backed
securities and commercial paper. The ECB also expanded its balance sheet
substantially (37 percent) in 2008 and made loans against a variety of assets,
but it did not undertake the same level of quantitative easing as either the
U.S. or U.K. central banks. The Bank of Japan did not expand its balance
94  |  Chapter 3

sheet on a similar scale.5 While it did expand some of its lending programs
in corporate bond markets, its policies were more oriented to financial
markets than to quantitative monetary policy. As noted earlier, Japan’s
inflation rate has been negative.

As Figure 3-10 shows, the rapid growth of central bank balance sheets
halted during 2009, but the central banks have not withdrawn the liquidity
they injected into the system. Similarly, policy interest rates have remained
constant since December 2008 in the United States and Japan and since the
spring of 2009 in the euro area and the United Kingdom. Some commodity
producers and smaller advanced nations with strong growth have begun to
withdraw some monetary accommodation. Australia, Israel, and Norway
have all raised policy interest rates. Also, authorities in countries such as
China and India had not raised main policy rates as of the end of 2009, but
they have made administrative changes that tightened lending to slow the
expansion of credit as their economies began to grow more quickly.
In addition to lending support, authorities directly intervened to
support the banking sectors in a number of countries. Countries took many
actions on their own, ranging from the policies pursued in the United States
such as the Troubled Asset Relief Program (discussed in Chapter 2), to direct
takeovers of some banks in the United Kingdom, to the creation of other
5

On December 1, 2009, the Bank of Japan announced a roughly $115 billion increase in lending,
equivalent to a nearly 10 percent increase in its balance sheet. This increase was significant but
still far below the actions taken by other major central banks.

Crisis and Recovery in the World Economy  |  95

entities to centralize some bad assets and clean the balance sheets of other
banks in Switzerland and Ireland, to general support and guarantees in a
wide range of countries.

Central Bank Liquidity Swaps
In addition to the coordination of rate cuts, one other important form
of international coordination took place across central banks. As noted, a
dollar funding shortage materialized abroad, as the normal channels for the
transmission of dollar liquidity from U.S. markets to the global financial
system broke down. This shortage presented a unique set of challenges
to central banks. They could have simply provided domestic currency
and left banks to sell it for dollars, but the foreign exchange swaps market
in which such transactions are usually conducted was severely impaired.
Alternatively, central banks could have used dollar reserves to provide
foreign currency funds, but few advanced countries (outside of Japan) had
sufficient foreign currency holdings to fully address the foreign currency
funding needs of their banking systems.
Central banks whose currencies were in demand responded to the
shortage by providing large amounts of liquidity to partner central banks
through central bank liquidity swaps.6 In many of these arrangements, the
Federal Reserve purchased foreign currency in exchange for U.S. dollars and
at the same time agreed to return the foreign currency for the same quantity
of dollars at a specific date in the future. When foreign central banks drew
dollars in this way to fund their auctions of dollar liquidity in local markets,
the Federal Reserve received interest equal to what the foreign central banks
were receiving on the lending operations. The Federal Reserve first used
these swaps in late 2007 on a relatively small scale. But, as shown in Figure
3-11, from August 2008 through December 2008 these swaps increased
from $67 billion to $553 billion. This massive supply of liquidity was larger
than the available lending facilities of the IMF. The United States extended
this program to major emerging market countries as well on October 29,
2008, providing lines of up to $30 billion each to Brazil, Mexico, Singapore,
and Korea.
As the acute funding needs have subsided, nearly all of the central
bank swaps have been unwound, and the Federal Reserve has announced
that it anticipates that these swap arrangements will be closed by February
1, 2010. There was no long-term funding cost to the Federal Reserve
from these swap lines; moreover, the Federal Reserve’s counterparties in
these transactions were the central banks of other countries, and the loans
6

involved in these transactions.

Although the dollar funding shortages were unique, the Federal
Reserve was not the only central bank to provide swap lines. Some of the
more notable examples include the European Central Bank, which made
euros available to a number of central banks in Europe, among them the
central banks of Denmark, Hungary, and Poland, that felt pressure for
funding in euros; the Swedish central bank, which provided support to
central banks in the Baltics; and the Swiss National Bank, which provided
Swiss francs to the European Central Bank and Poland. Across Asia there
was renewed interest in the Chiang Mai Initiative, under which various
Asian central banks set up swap lines that could be used in an emergency.
Despite the increases in these cross-Asian country swap lines, together they
totaled $90 billion, far less than the available Federal Reserve swap lines, and
they were not drawn on during the crisis. In sum, while existing institutional structures (IMF lending or reserves) appear to have been insufficient
to meet this aspect of the crisis, the world’s central banks innovated to take
temporary actions that quelled market disruptions and avoided even sharper
financial dislocation.

Crisis and Recovery in the World Economy  |  97

Fiscal Policy in the Crisis
In part because major central banks had pushed interest rates as low
as they could go and in part because of the magnitude of the crisis, by the
beginning of 2009, many countries decided to institute substantial fiscal
stimulus. The hope was that government spending could step into the
breach left by the collapse of private demand and provide the necessary lift
to prevent a slide into a deep recession or worse.
Nearly every major country instituted stimulus, with the exception of
some countries hampered by substantial public finance concerns, such as
Hungary and Ireland. Every G-20 nation implemented substantial stimulus,
with an unweighted average of 2.0 percent of GDP in 2009 (Table 3-1), and
many other OECD nations also adopted stimulus plans. Among G-20 countries, China, Korea, Russia, and Saudi Arabia enacted the most extensive
stimulus programs in 2009, all equivalent to more than 3 percent of GDP.
The U.S. stimulus in 2009 (estimated at 2 percent of GDP) was greater than
the OECD’s estimate of its member country average (1.6 percent of GDP),
but the same as the G-20 average and not quite as extensive as the four
high-stimulus nations.

Discretionary fiscal action was not the only form of fiscal stimulus;
automatic stabilizers (unemployment insurance, welfare, reduction in taxes
collected due to lower payrolls) are triggered when an economy slows down.
The size of automatic stabilizers present in an economy appears to be negatively correlated with the size of discretionary stimulus. As Figure 3-12
shows, those countries that already had large automatic stabilizers in place

appear to have adopted less discretionary fiscal stimulus, but they were obviously still providing substantial fiscal relief during the crisis.7

Stimulus is expected to fade slowly in 2010. Overall, the IMF estimates
that advanced G-20 countries will spend 1.6 percent of GDP on discretionary stimulus in 2010, compared with 1.9 percent in 2009.8 Emerging
and developing G-20 countries will also spend 1.6 percent of GDP in 2010,
compared with 2.2 percent in 2009. The IMF projects that among the G-20
countries that adopted large stimulus programs, only Germany, Korea, and
Saudi Arabia will increase those programs in 2010. In addition, substantial
stimulus will continue into 2010 in Australia, Canada, China, and the United

The level of taxation in the economy is used as a proxy for automatic stabilizers. Countries with
large levels of taxation see immediate automatic stabilizers because any lost income immediately
reduces taxes. Those same countries often tend to have more generous social safety nets (funded
by their higher taxes).

The averages are calculated by the IMF using PPP GDP weights. That is, the IMF uses the size
of an economy—evaluated at purchasing power parity exchange rates, which take into account
different prices for different types of goods and services—to weight the different countries in
the averages.

States.9 Thus, substantial fiscal stimulus should continue to support the
recovering world economy. The crucial question will be whether sufficient
private demand has been rekindled by late 2010 to pick up the economic
slack as stimulus unwinds.

Trade Policy in the Crisis
An extremely welcome development is the policy that was not called
on during the crisis: trade protectionism. Frequently viewed as an accelerant of the Great Depression, protectionism has been largely absent during
the current crisis. In the Great Depression, trade protectionism came into
play after the crisis had started and was not a cause of the Depression itself
(Eichengreen and Irwin 2009). But the extensive barriers that built up in the
first few years of the Depression meant that as production rebounded, trade
levels could not do so. In the current crisis, rather than respond to declining
exports with increasing tariffs, countries left markets open, allowing for the
possibility of a rebound in world trade. No major country has instituted
dramatic trade restrictions. Furthermore, while antidumping and countervailing duty investigations have increased, the value of imports facing
possible new import restrictions by G-20 countries stemming from new
trade remedy investigations begun between 2008:Q1 and 2009:Q1 represents
less than 0.5 percent of those countries’ imports (Bown forthcoming).

The Role of International Institutions
Rather than resort to beggar-thy-neighbor policies, this crisis has been
characterized by international policy coordination. National policies did
not take place in a vacuum; to the contrary, nations used a number of international institutions to coordinate and communicate their rescue efforts.

The G-20
The G-20, which includes 19 nations plus the European Union, was
the locus of much of the coordination on trade policy, financial policy, and
crisis response. Its membership is composed of most of the world’s largest
economies—both advanced and emerging—and makes up nearly 90 percent
of world gross national product.
The first G-20 leaders’ summit was held at the peak of the crisis in
November 2008. At that point, G-20 countries committed to keep their
markets open, adopt policies to support the global economy, and stabilize
the financial sector. Leaders also began discussing financial reforms that
would help prevent a repeat of the crisis.
9

Japan has announced additional stimulus since these estimates and will also be providing
extensive stimulus in 2010.

100  |  Chapter 3

The second G-20 leaders’ summit took place in April 2009 at the
height of concern about rapid falls in GDP and trade. Leaders of the world’s
largest economies pledged to “do everything necessary to ensure recovery,
to repair our financial systems and to maintain the global flow of capital.”
Furthermore, they committed to work together on tax and financial policies. Perhaps the most notable act of world coordination was the decision to
provide substantial new funding to the IMF. U.S. leadership helped secure a
commitment by the G-20 leaders to provide over $800 billion to fund multilateral banks broadly, with over $500 billion of those funds allocated to the
IMF in particular.
In September 2009, the G-20 leaders met in Pittsburgh. They noted
that international cooperation and national action had been critical in
arresting the crisis and putting the world’s economies on the path toward
recovery. They also recognized that continued action was necessary, pledged
to “sustain our strong policy response until a durable recovery is secured,”
and committed to avoid premature withdrawal of stimulus. The leaders also
focused on the policies, regulations, and reforms that would be needed to
ensure a strong recovery while avoiding the practices and vulnerabilities that
gave rise to boom-bust cycles and the current crisis. They launched a new
Framework for Strong, Sustainable, and Balanced Growth that committed
the G-20 countries to work together to assess how their policies fit together
and evaluate whether they were “collectively consistent with more sustainable and balanced growth.” Further, the leaders committed to act together
to improve the global financial system through financial regulatory reforms
and actions to increase capital in the system.
Given the central role the G-20 had played in the response to the
crisis, it is not surprising that the leaders agreed in Pittsburgh to make the
G-20 the premier forum for their economic coordination. This shift reflects
the growing importance of key emerging economies such as India and
China—a shift that was reinforced by the agreement in Pittsburgh to realign
quota shares and voting weights in the IMF and World Bank to better reflect
shifts in the global economy.

The International Monetary Fund
The IMF’s role has changed considerably over time, from being
the shepherd of the world’s Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system to
becoming a crisis manager. In a systemic bank run, a central bank sometimes steps in as the lender of last resort. The IMF is not a central bank and
can neither print money nor regulate countries’ behavior in advance of a
crisis, but it has played a coordinating and funding role in many crises. As
the scale of the current crisis became apparent, it was clear that the IMF’s
Crisis and Recovery in the World Economy  |  101

funds were insufficient to backstop a large systemic crisis, particularly in
advanced nations. While it is still unlikely to be able to arrest a run on
major advanced country financial systems, the increase in resources stemming from the G-20 summit has roughly tripled the resources available to
the IMF and left it better suited to quell runs in individual countries.
As the IMF’s resources were expanded, the institution took a number
of concrete interventions. It set up emergency lines of credit (called Flexible
Credit Lines) with Colombia, Mexico, and Poland, which in total are worth
over $80 billion. These lines were intended to provide immediate liquidity
in the event of a run by investors, but also to signal to the markets that
funds were available, making a run less likely. Now, rather than have to
go to the IMF for funds during a crisis, these countries are “pre-approved”
for loans. In each of these countries, markets responded positively to the
announcement of the credit lines, with the cost of insuring the countries’
bonds narrowing (International Monetary Fund 2009b). The IMF also
negotiated a set of standby agreements with 15 countries, committing a
total of $75 billion to help them survive the economic crisis by smoothing
current account adjustments and mitigating liquidity pressures. IMF
analysis suggests that this program discouraged large exchange-rate swings
in these countries (International Monetary Fund 2009b). These actions as
well as the very existence of a better-funded global lender may have helped
to keep the contraction short and to prevent sustained currency crises in
many emerging nations.

The Beginning of Recovery Around the Globe
In contrast to the Great Depression, where poor policy actions—
monetary, fiscal, regulatory, and protectionist—helped turn a sharp global
downturn into the worst worldwide collapse the modern economy has
known, the recent massive policy response helped stop the spiraling of
this Great Recession. Already financial markets have stabilized, GDP has
begun to grow, and trade has begun to rebound. The crisis is far from over,
however; most notably, employment in many countries is still distressingly
weak. But the world economy appears to have avoided the outright collapse
that was feared at one point and is now moving toward recovery.
The second quarter of 2009 saw the first hints of recovery in many
countries. World average growth was 2.4 percent, and even OECD countries registered a positive 0.2 percent growth rate.10 The rebound caught
many by surprise. The IMF and the OECD had revised projections steadily

accounts database.

downward through the winter and spring, but by the middle of 2009 many
economies had returned to growth. The one-quarter improvement in annualized growth of 5.7 percentage points (from -6.4 percent to -0.7 percent
from the first to the second quarter of 2009) in the United States was one
of the largest improvements in decades, but other countries that had deeper
contractions rebounded even more. Annualized growth rates improved
more than 14 percentage points in Germany and Japan, while growth rates
rose more than 30 percentage points in Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and
Turkey. Other emerging markets, such as China, India, and Indonesia,
which did not contract but faced lower growth during the crisis, rebounded
to growth rates on par with their performance during the 2000s (if not the
rapid booms of 2006–07).
Trade had collapsed quickly, and it has begun to rebound quickly as
well. Beginning in March, when GDP was still falling rapidly, exports began
to turn. From lows in February 2009, nominal world goods exports in dollar
terms had grown 20 percent by October. U.S. nominal goods exports picked
up later but had grown 17 percent from their April lows by October. As
GDP began to rise, trade volume began to grow faster. Annualized growth
for world real exports was 2.4 percent in the second quarter of 2009 and
16.8 percent in the third quarter. By comparison, world weighted average
annualized real GDP growth in the second and third quarters of 2009 was
2.4 percent and 3.4 percent, respectively.
Financial markets are rebounding as well. Net cross-border financial
flows are near their pre-crisis levels, and gross flows are increasing (although
as of October 2009 they were still less than 80 percent of their average level
in 2008). Libor-OIS spreads have fallen to more typical levels, and equivalent measures in other markets have subsided as well. Stock market indexes
in the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the European Union
have all risen substantially. By October 2009, all were above their levels in
October 2008, making up dramatic losses in early 2009. House prices have
stabilized in most markets. Furthermore, the cost of insuring emergingmarket bonds, which had spiked in the fall of 2008, is now back roughly to
its pre-crisis level. The value of the dollar, which rose dramatically during
the crisis, has retreated toward its value before the crisis (see Figure 3-2).
From the end of March 2009 through December, the dollar depreciated
10 percent against a basket of currencies. The trade-weighted value is
roughly at the same level as in the fall of 2007 and above its lows in 2008.
Potential financial problems still exist. Banks around the world may
not have recognized all the losses on their balance sheets. The shock waves
from the threatened default by Dubai World in November 2009 showed
that there are still concerns in the market about potential bad debts on
Crisis and Recovery in the World Economy  |  103

various entities’ balance sheets. There also are concerns in some countries
that asset prices may be rising ahead of fundamentals. But the crush of
near-bankruptcy across the system has clearly eased.

The Impact of Fiscal Policy
The broad financial rescues and the monetary policy responses played
crucial roles in stabilizing financial markets. Fiscal policy also played an
essential role in the macroeconomic turnaround. A simple examination
of G-20 advanced economies shows that while they all had broadly similar
GDP contractions during the crisis, the high-stimulus countries—despite
having much smaller automatic stabilizers—grew faster after the crisis than
countries that adopted smaller stimulus packages. Table 3-2 shows the
2009 discretionary fiscal stimulus as a share of GDP, the tax share of GDP
(which is a rough estimate of automatic stabilizers), as well as the GDP
growth during the two quarters of crisis (2008:Q4 and 2009:Q1) and the
second quarter of 2009 when growth resumed in many countries. Growth
reappeared first in the high-stimulus G-20 countries.

Countries may have different typical growth patterns, however. Thus,
to understand the impact of fiscal stimulus, one must estimate what would
have happened had there been no stimulus—a counterfactual. Private sector
expectations in November 2008—after the crisis had begun but before most
stimulus packages were adopted—can serve as that counterfactual. Thus,
one can compare actual growth minus predicted growth with the degree
of stimulus to see whether those countries with large stimulus packages
outperformed expectations once the stimulus policies were in place. The
second quarter of 2009 is used as the test case. Figure 3-13 shows actual
growth minus expected growth compared with 2009 discretionary fiscal

stimulus for the OECD countries for which private sector forecasts were
available on a consistent date.11 Countries with larger stimulus on average
exceeded expectations to a greater degree than those with smaller stimulus
packages. The two countries in this exercise with the largest stimulus packages, Korea and Japan, outperformed expectations by dramatic amounts.
Countries such as Italy that had virtually no stimulus performed worse than
most. Among non-OECD countries, China had one of the largest fiscal
stimulus packages, and in the second quarter of 2009 its growth was both
rapid and far in excess of what had been expected in November 2008. Fiscal

Stimulus is measured as in Table 3-1, using IMF and OECD estimates of 2009 fiscal stimulus.
Forecasts are from J.P.Morgan. See Council of Economic Advisers (2009) for more details. That
report examines more countries and a set of time series forecasts in addition to the private sector
(J.P.Morgan) forecasts. The results are quite similar with a simple time series forecast. Results
are slightly weaker with a broader sample, but that is not surprising because the swings in the
economies in emerging markets were quite severe and difficult to predict, and the stimulus policies may operate somewhat differently in those nations. Council of Economic Advisers (2009)
used Brookings estimates as well as OECD and IMF, but those ceased being updated in March,
and thus this analysis uses only IMF and OECD estimates. Using the June estimates alone
slightly weakens the results because stimulus announced late in the second quarter likely had
little impact on growth in that quarter.

Crisis and Recovery in the World Economy  |  105

stimulus seems to have been important in restarting world economic growth
in the second quarter of 2009.
After the second quarter of 2009, the relationship between stimulus
and growth weakens somewhat. High-stimulus countries still exceed
expectations relative to low-stimulus countries, but the relationship is not
statistically significant. It may be that quarterly growth projections made
nearly a year in advance are not precise enough a measure of a third-quarter
growth counterfactual.

The World Economy in the Near Term
While the return to GDP and export growth is encouraging, exports
are still far below their level in the summer of 2008, and GDP is now far
below its prior trend level. The IMF currently forecasts annual world growth
of 3.1 percent in 2010; the OECD projects 3.4 percent.12 For advanced countries, the forecasts are even more restrained: the IMF projects 1.3 percent,
the OECD 1.9 percent for OECD countries. The IMF forecasts world trade
to grow 2.5 percent in 2010; the OECD, 6.0 percent. These forecasts may
be conservative. The IMF forecast would leave trade at a much lower share
of GDP than before the crisis, and even if trade growth met the OECD’s
more aggressive forecast, trade would not reach its previous level as a share
of GDP for some time. Given that trade declined faster than GDP in the
crisis, it is possible it will continue to bounce back faster as well, surpassing
these estimates.
How Fast Will Countries Grow? There is an open question about
how fast countries will grow following the crisis. After typical recessions, the
magnitude of a recovery often matches the depth of the drop. In this way,
GDP returns not only to its previous growth rate, but to its previous trend
path as well. If, however, the world’s advanced economies emerge from the
crisis only slowly and simply return to stable growth rates, output will be
on a permanently lower path. A financial crisis could lower the future level
of output by generating lower levels of labor, capital, or the productivity of
those factors. If the economy returns to full employment, and productivity
growth remains on trend, though, capital should eventually return to its
pre-crisis path because the incentives to invest will be high. Thus, as long
as the economy eventually returns to full employment, the long-run impact
of the crisis chiefly rests on productivity growth in the years ahead. Chapter
10 discusses the prospects and importance of productivity in more detail.
Some research suggests financial crises may result in a slow growth
pattern (International Monetary Fund 2009a), with substantial average

losses in the level of output in the years following a financial crisis. The same
research, however, shows a wide variety of experiences following crises, with
a substantial number of countries returning to or exceeding the pre-crisis
trend level path of GDP. It is far too early to project the likely outcome
of this recession and recovery, but there is hope that the aggressive policy
responses and the potential for a sharp uptick in world trade—bouncing
back with responsiveness similar in magnitude to its downturn—will return
the path of GDP to previous trend levels in many economies.
Concerns about Unemployment. One reason for the great concern
about the pace of growth after the recession is the current employment situation. What was a financial crisis and then a real economy and trade crisis
has rapidly become a jobs crisis in many advanced economies. The OECD
projects the average unemployment rate in OECD countries will have risen
2.3 percentage points from 2008 to 2009, with an average jobless rate of
8.2 percent in 2009. More worryingly, the OECD projects the group average
will continue rising in 2010, and in some areas (such as the euro area) the
jobless rate is expected to be even higher in 2011.
The United States has been an outlier in the extent to which the GDP
contraction has turned into an employment contraction. Figure 3-14 shows
the change in GDP and in the unemployment rate from the first quarter
of 2008 to the second quarter of 2009. Typically, one would expect a line
running from the upper left to the lower right because countries with small
declines in GDP (or even increases) would have small increases in unemployment (lower right) and those with larger declines in GDP would have
larger increases in unemployment (upper left). Countries broadly fit this
pattern during the current crisis and recovery, but there are a number of
aberrations. Germany saw a large contraction in GDP, and while growth
has resumed, its one-year contraction was still sizable. Still, Germany’s
unemployment rate barely increased. In contrast, the United States suffered
a relatively mild output contraction (for an OECD country), and yet it has
had the largest jump in the unemployment rate outside of Iceland, Ireland,
Spain, and Turkey, all of which had larger GDP declines.
There are several partial explanations for the large variation in the
GDP-unemployment relationship across countries. The more flexible labor
markets in the United States make the usual response of unemployment
to output movements larger than in most other OECD countries; and, as
discussed in Chapter 2, the rise in U.S. unemployment in the current episode
has been unusually large given the output decline. Another factor is a policy
response in some countries aimed at keeping current employees in current
jobs. The extreme example of such a policy has been Germany’s Kurzarbeit
(short-time work) program, which subsidizes companies that put workers

on shorter shifts rather than firing them. The OECD estimates the German
unemployment rate would be roughly 1 percentage point higher without
the program. Because such programs benefit only those who already have
jobs, they could hold down unemployment at the cost of a more rigid labor
market. Labor market flexibility is generally seen as allowing lower unemployment on average over the course of the business cycle and as permitting
a more efficient distribution of labor resources, thus enhancing productivity.

Global Imbalances in the Crisis
In addition to the unambiguous signs of problems in the U.S. economy
going into the crisis, there were clear signals that the global economy was
not well balanced. Global growth was strong from 2002 to 2007, but the
growth was not well distributed around the world economy, with fast
growth in some emerging markets and sluggish growth in some advanced
economies. Further, that growth came with mounting imbalances in saving
and borrowing across the world. U.S. saving was very low, which led to
substantial borrowing from the rest of the world. Home price bubbles and
overborrowing were not exclusive to the United States; the United Kingdom,
Spain, and many other economies also borrowed extensively, helping inflate

108  |  Chapter 3

asset prices in those economies. This borrowing was paired with very high
saving in some countries, particularly in emerging Asia.
The extent to which the global imbalances were a cause of the crisis
or represented a symptom of poor policy choices in different countries is a
question of active debate (see Obstfeld and Rogoff 2009 for discussion). The
current account (net borrowing from or lending to the rest of the world) can
be defined as a country’s saving minus its investment. Thus, some argue
that forces in the rest of the world cannot be deterministic of a country’s
current account balance. A country saves or borrows based on its own
choices. In this formulation, the imbalances were merely a symptom. In
fact, some argued the imbalances were beneficial because savings were channeled away from inefficient financial markets in poor countries toward what
were thought to be more efficient markets in rich countries. Conversely,
some argue that the influx of global savings into the United States distorted
incentives by keeping interest rates too low and led to overborrowing and
asset bubbles. In this view, the imbalances played a leading role in the crisis.
The truth almost certainly lies somewhere in between. The influx of
global savings into the United States did lower borrowing rates and encouraged more spending and less saving within the U.S. economy. This may
have allowed the credit expansion and related asset price bubbles to continue
longer than they could have otherwise. At the same time, even if the global
savings in some sense led to U.S. borrowing, the failure of the financial
system to use that borrowing productively and the failure of regulation to
make sure risk was being treated appropriately were surely partly to blame
for the crisis.
As the U.S. economy seeks to find a more sure footing and a growth
path less dependent on borrowing and bubbles, world demand needs to be
redistributed so that it is less dependent on the U.S. consumer and does not
cause global imbalances to reappear and contribute to distortions in the
economy. Fixing the imbalances can help provide more demand for the
U.S. economy. But these imbalances also need to be treated as symptoms of
deeper regulatory and policy failures. Fixing the imbalances alone will not
prevent another crisis.
Since the onset of the crisis, the imbalances have partially unwound
(the likely future path of the U.S. current account is discussed in more detail
in Chapter 4). The U.S. current account deficit, which had built to over
6 percent of GDP in 2006, was on a downward path before the crisis struck
in full force, falling to under 5 percent of GDP at the start of 2008. After the
crisis hit, it fell below 3 percent of GDP in the first quarter of 2009. Major
surplus countries—China, Germany, and Japan—have all seen a reduction in their current account surpluses from the highs of 2007. In all three
Crisis and Recovery in the World Economy  |  109

cases, the surpluses have stabilized at substantial levels (in the range of 3–5
percent of GDP), but they are notably down from their highs. One essential part of the response to the crisis has been the substantial fiscal stimulus
implemented by these three countries, which has helped demand in these
countries stay stronger than it otherwise would have been.
Figure 3-15, which shows current account imbalances scaled to world
GDP, demonstrates how much of total world excess saving or borrowing
is attributable to individual countries. As the figure makes clear, by 2005
and 2006, the United States was borrowing nearly 2 percent of world GDP,
and by the end of 2008, China was lending nearly 1 percent of world GDP.
During the crisis, the surpluses of OPEC (Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries) countries, Japan, and Germany contracted, and the
United States is now borrowing less than 1 percent of world GDP. China’s
surplus is also smaller than before the crisis, but China is still lending nearly
0.5 percent of world GDP, and OPEC surpluses may rise as well. But by the
third quarter of 2009, the degree of imbalance was substantially lower than
just a year earlier. There is hope that the short-run moves in these current
account balances are not simply cyclical factors that will return quickly to

former levels but rather that they represent a more sustained rebalancing of
world demand.
Net export growth is often a key source of growth propelling a country
out of a financial crisis. But in a global crisis, not every country can increase
exports and decrease imports simultaneously. Someone must buy the
products that are being sold, and the world’s current accounts must balance
out. Thus far, the crisis has come with a reduction in imbalances, with
strong growth and smaller surpluses in many surplus countries. Whether
these shifts become a permanent part of the world economy or policies and
growth models revert to the pattern of the 2000s will be an important area
for policy coordination.

Conclusion
The period from September 2008 to the end of 2009 will be
remembered as a historic period in the world economy. The drops in GDP
and trade may stand for many decades as the largest worldwide economic
crisis since the Great Depression. In contrast to the Depression, however,
the history of the period may also show how aggressive policy action and
international coordination can help turn the world economy from the edge
of disaster. The recovery is unsteady and, especially with regard to unemployment, incomplete, but compared with a year ago, the positive shift in
trends in the world economy has been dramatic.

saving and investment

T

he United States appears poised to begin its recovery from the most
severe recession since the Great Depression. But as discussed in Chapter
2, the recession has been unusually deep, and the crisis has caused declines
in credit availability as well as weak consumer and business confidence. As a
result, achieving the private spending necessary to support a robust and full
recovery has been, and will continue to be, challenging.
Moreover, as the President has repeatedly emphasized, it is not
enough simply to return to the path the economy was on before the slump.
The growth that preceded the recession saw high consumption spending,
low private saving, excessive housing construction, unsustainable run-ups
in asset prices (especially for assets related directly or indirectly to housing),
and high budget and trade deficits. That path was unstable—as we have
learned at enormous cost—and undermined long-run prosperity. Thus, as
the economy recovers, a rebalancing will be necessary. The composition
of spending needs to be reoriented in a way that will put us on a path to
sustained, stable prosperity.
In thinking about the twin challenges of recovery and reorientation, it
is useful to consider the division of demand into its components. Overall or
aggregate demand can be classified into personal consumption expenditures,
residential investment, business investment, net exports, and government
purchases of goods and services. Government purchases, which consist of
such items as Federal expenditures on national defense and state and local
spending on education, are relatively stable. This is especially true when one
recalls that government transfers, such as spending on Medicare or Social
Security, are not part of government purchases but rather are elements of
personal income. Thus, it is the behavior of the remaining components that
will be central to addressing the challenges of generating enough demand
for recovery and a better composition of demand for long-run growth
and stability.
113

This chapter lays out a picture of how the components of private
demand behaved during the downturn and how they are likely to evolve as
the economy recovers and once it returns to full employment. The chapter
describes the transition that has already occurred away from low personal
saving and high residential investment, as well as the transition that needs to
occur toward greater business investment and net exports. It also describes
the President’s initiatives for encouraging the transitions necessary for longrun prosperity and stability.

The Path of Consumption Spending
Figure 4-1 shows the share of gross domestic product (GDP) that
takes the form of production of goods and services directly purchased by
consumers. The figure has two key messages. First, consumption represents
a substantial majority of output. As a result, movements in consumption
play a central role in macroeconomic outcomes. Second, the fraction of
output devoted to consumption has been rising over time, leaving less room
for components that contribute to future standards of living. The behavior
of consumption will therefore be central to addressing both the shorter-run
challenge of generating a strong recovery and the longer-run challenge of
rebalancing the economy.

The Determinants of Saving
To understand the behavior of consumption, it is critical to consider
how households divide their disposable income between consumption and
saving. Figure 4-2 shows the personal saving rate (that is, the ratio of saving
to disposable personal income) since 1960 (left axis), along with the ratio of
household wealth to disposable personal income (right axis).

The big swings in wealth reflect asset market booms and busts. Much
of the drop in wealth in the early 1970s reflects the stock market decline
associated with the first oil price shock. The stock market booms of the mid1980s and the late 1990s are obvious, as is the decline in stock prices in the
early 2000s. The wealth decline in 2008–09 was the largest such experience
in the sample, reflecting large contributions from falling house prices as well
as stock prices.
Paralleling the behavior of the consumption-output ratio, the saving
rate showed no strong trend before roughly 1980. But it has shown a marked
downward trend since then. Economic theory suggests a variety of factors
that should influence saving, most notably changes in the demographic
structure of the population, the growth rate of income, and the real after-tax
interest rate. None of these three factors, however, provides a compelling
explanation for the fluctuations in the saving rate evident in the figure.
Saving and Investment  |  115

Indeed, some of the factors should probably have pushed saving up in recent
decades, not down. A 1991 study, for example, predicted that the saving rate
would rise as the baby boom generation entered its high-saving preretirement years (Auerbach, Cai, and Kotlikoff 1991). Instead, the saving rate fell
steadily as the boomers approached retirement (the first boomers claimed
early Social Security benefits in 2008).
Figure 4-2 suggests to the eye, and statistical analysis confirms, a
strong negative association between the saving rate and the wealth-toincome ratio. This relationship has been interpreted as reflecting the effect
of wealth on spending: a run-up in wealth leads to less need for saving.
Such an interpretation is unsatisfying, however, because it leaves a key question unanswered: If wealth movements cause saving rate movements, what
causes wealth movements? More broadly, it leaves open the possibility that
both saving choices and asset price movements are a consequence of some
deeper underlying force. For example, an increase in optimism about future
economic conditions might lead both to a spending boom and to a general
bidding up of asset prices. In that case, the true moving force would not
be wealth changes per se; instead, both asset prices and saving would be
responding to the increase in optimism.
Survey data measuring “consumer sentiment” or “consumer confidence” do, in fact, have substantial forecasting power for near-term spending
growth, and are also associated with contemporaneous movements in asset
prices (Carroll, Fuhrer, and Wilcox 1994). Such surveys are therefore a
useful part of a macroeconomist’s forecasting tool kit. But such surveys have
not proven useful in explaining long-term trends like the secular decline in
the saving rate.
Emerging economic research suggests another underlying
explanation that may be more potent: movements in the availability of
credit. A substantial academic literature has documented the expansion of
credit since the era of financial liberalization that began in the early 1980s
(Dynan 2009). Many factors have contributed to this expansion; perhaps the
most prominent explanation (aside from the liberalization itself) is the telecommunications and computer revolutions, which together have permitted
the construction of ever-more-detailed databases on consumer credit histories, giving creditors a far more precise ability to tailor credit offers to the
personal characteristics of individual borrowers (Jappelli and Pagano 1993).
A beneficial effect of this information revolution has been that many people
who had previously been unable to obtain credit have for the first time been
able to borrow to buy a home, to start a business, or to undertake many other
useful activities (Edelberg 2006; Getter 2006).

116  |  Chapter 4

A reduction in saving, however, is almost the inevitable consequence
of a general increase in the ability to borrow. If there is less need to save
for a down payment for a home, for a child’s education, for unforeseen
emergencies, or for spending of any other kind, then the likelihood is that
less saving will be done. Of course, eventually the saving rate should mostly
recover from any dip caused by a one-time increase in the availability of
credit, because whatever extra debt was incurred must be paid back over
time (and paying back debt is another form of saving). This recovery in
saving, however, may take a long time. If, in the meantime, credit availability increases again, the gradual small increase in saving that reflects debt
repayment could easily be obscured by the new drop in saving occasioned by
the continuing expansion in credit availability.
How much of the decline in the saving rate was due to a gradual, but
cumulatively large, increase in credit availability is not easy to determine,
partly because an aggregate measure of credit availability is difficult to
construct. Recent research on commercial lending has argued that a good
measure of the change in credit supply is provided by the Federal Reserve’s
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, in which
managers at leading financial institutions are asked for their assessments
of credit conditions for businesses (Lown and Morgan 2006). Building on
that research, one study has proposed that a measure of the level of credit
availability to consumers can be constructed simply by accumulating the
sequence of readings from this survey’s measure of credit availability to
consumers (Muellbauer 2007).1
Economic theory suggests that one further element may be important
in understanding spending and saving choices around times of recession:
the intensity of consumers’ precautionary motive for saving. Because the
risk of becoming unemployed is perhaps the greatest threat to most people’s
future financial stability, the unemployment rate has sometimes been used
as a proxy for the intensity of the precautionary saving motive.

Implications for Recent and Future Saving Behavior
Figure 4-3 shows the relationship between the measured saving rate
and a simple statistical model that relates the saving rate to the wealth-toincome ratio, a slightly modified version of Muellbauer’s credit availability
index, and the unemployment rate. The statistical model is estimated over
the sample period 1966:Q3 to 2009:Q3. All three variables have statistically
important predictive power, with the two most important measures being
the measure of credit conditions and the wealth-to-income ratio.

Specifically, each quarter the survey asks about banks’ willingness to make consumer installment loans now as opposed to three months ago.

Figure 4-4 uses this simple framework to ask what the path of the
saving rate might have looked like if the increase in credit availability and the
housing price boom had not occurred. (To be exact, the figure shows what
the model says the saving rate would have been if the wealth-to-income ratio
had remained constant from the first quarter of 2003 to the fourth quarter
of 2007, and if credit conditions had neither expanded nor contracted; the
first quarter of 2003 is chosen as the starting point because in that quarter
the wealth-to-income ratio was close to its average historical value.) In this
counterfactual history, the personal saving rate would have been, on average,
about 2 percentage points higher over the 2003–07 period.
Of course, a far more important consequence than the higher saving
rate might have been the avoidance of the financial and real disturbances
caused by the housing price boom and subsequent crash. But taking the
crash as given, Figure 4-3 shows that the model does a reasonably good job
in tracking the dynamics of the saving rate over the period since the business cycle peak. All three elements of the model contribute to the model’s
predicted rise in the personal saving rate over the past couple of years: the
increase in the unemployment rate, the sharp drop in asset values evident
in Figure 4-2, and the steep drop in credit availability as measured by the
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey.

The saving model also has implications for the future path of
spending. Because of the important role it finds for credit availability,
the model suggests that the speed of the recovery in spending is likely to
be closely tied to the pace at which the financial sector returns to health.
This point underscores a chief motivation for the Administration’s efforts
to repair the damage to the financial system: a full economic recovery is
unlikely until and unless the financial system is repaired. The vital role that
a healthy financial sector plays in the functioning of the economy explains
the urgency with which the Administration has been pressing Congress to
pass a comprehensive and effective reform of the financial regulatory system
(see Chapter 6 for a detailed discussion of the Administration’s proposals).
Over a longer time frame, a resumption seems unlikely of the past
pattern in which credit growth persistently outpaces income growth. Instead,
credit might reasonably be expected to expand, in the long run, at a pace that
roughly matches the rate of income growth. Similarly, in keeping with the
long-run stability of the wealth-to-income ratio evident in Figure 4-2, wealth
plausibly might grow at roughly the same pace as income—or perhaps a bit
faster if investment can sustain an increase in capital per worker. Finally,
although unemployment is likely to remain above its normal rate for some
time, it too can be expected to return to historically normal values in the
medium run. Under these conditions, the model suggests that the personal
Saving and Investment  |  119

saving rate will eventually stabilize somewhere in the range of 4 to 7 percent,
somewhat below its level in the 1960s and 1970s, but well above its level over
the past decade.
The saving rate has already risen sharply over the past two years
(which reflects an even steeper drop in consumption than in income).
As credit conditions and the unemployment rate return to normal, it is
plausible to expect a temporary partial reversal of the recent increase,
even if asset values do not return to their pre-crisis levels. It would not be
surprising, therefore, if the saving rate dipped a bit over the next year or two
before heading toward a higher long-run equilibrium value. The prospect
of temporary fallback in the saving rate is also plausible as a consequence of
the expected withdrawal of some of the temporary income support policies
that were part of the stimulus package. On balance, however, the United
States seems now to be on a trajectory that will eventually result in a more
“normal,” and more sustainable, pattern of household saving and spending
than the one that has prevailed in recent years.
While the underlying economic forces sketched here seem likely
to lead eventually to a higher saving rate even in the absence of policy
changes, the Administration has proposed a variety of saving-promoting
policy changes to enhance that trend over the longer term. These include
increasing the availability of 401(k)-type saving plans and encouraging
employers to gradually increase default contribution rates (and to ensure
that new employees’ default saving choices reflect sound financial planning).
Economic research suggests that people assume that if their employer offers
a retirement saving plan, the default saving rate in that plan probably reflects
a reasonably good choice for them, unless their circumstances are unusual
(Benartzi and Thaler 2004).

The Future of the Housing Market
and Construction
The boom in construction spending that characterized the middle
years of the past decade made a substantial contribution to growth while it
lasted. When the residential investment engine began to sputter around the
middle of 2006, and then to stall, the ensuing correction in the sector was
correspondingly steep. With the benefit of hindsight, it is now clear that
much of the mid-decade’s frenetic activity was based on unsound financial
decisions rather than sustainable economic developments. As a consequence, construction has declined to below-normal levels as the excesses
work off. For the future, construction activity is expected to pick up and

120  |  Chapter 4

contribute to the economic recovery, although this activity is likely to be well
below the very high levels it reached in the mid-2000s.

The Housing Market
The residential investment boom can be measured in several ways. As
Figure 4-5 shows, new construction of single-family housing units soared
in the first half of the 2000s. Builders were constructing 30 percent more
single-family housing units a year in the expansion of the 2000s than in the
1990s boom. Housing investment as a share of GDP averaged more than
5.5 percent over the 2002–06 period, compared with an average of only
4.7 percent from 1950 to 2001. Figure 4-6 shows that from 1995 to 2005
the homeownership rate rose from 65 percent to 69 percent as mortgage
underwriting standards loosened, especially in the later part of the period.

It is now apparent that the mid-2000s level of new construction was
unsustainable. Analysis by the Congressional Budget Office (2008) and
Macroeconomic Advisers (2009) suggests the mid-2000s pace of starts
was well in excess of the underlying pace of expansion in demand for new
housing units based on household formation and other demographic drivers.

The boom was followed by an equally dramatic bust. From their peak
in the third quarter of 2005 to the first quarter of 2009, single-family housing
starts fell by more than a factor of four. The homeownership rate reversed
course, and by the second quarter of 2009 had returned to its 2000 level. The
share of housing investment in GDP plummeted to 2.4 percent in the second
quarter of 2009.
Just as the mid-decade’s high levels of construction and housing
market activity were not sustainable, the recent extremely low levels of
construction will not persist indefinitely. In 2009, housing starts and the
share of housing investment in GDP were well below their previous historical lows. In the long run, sounder underwriting standards will require
more would-be homeowners to take time to save for a down payment before
buying a home, suggesting that the homeownership rate will ultimately
settle at a level lower than its recent peaks. Nonetheless, as the population grows and the housing stock depreciates, new residential construction
will be required to meet demand. The analyses by the Congressional
Budget Office (2008) and Macroeconomic Advisers (2009) suggest that
the underlying demographic trend of household formation is consistent
with growth in demand of between 1.1 million and 1.3 million new singlefamily housing units per year, more than double the pace of single-family
housing starts in November 2009. Indeed, since the second quarter of 2009,
housing construction has already rebounded a bit, making its first positive
122  |  Chapter 4

contribution to GDP growth in the third quarter of 2009 since the end of
2005. But, as described in Chapter 2, the stocks of new homes and existing
homes for sale, vacant homes that are not currently on the market, and
homes that are in the process of foreclosure and that are likely to be put on
the market at some point remain high. As a result, construction demand is
likely to rise to its long-run level only gradually while some demand is met
by the stock of existing units.
In short, as the housing market stabilizes and returns to a more normal
condition, its role as a major drag on economic growth seems to be ending,
and it is likely to contribute to the recovery. But residential construction
cannot be expected to be the engine for GDP growth that it was during the
housing boom of the mid-2000s.

Commercial Real Estate
The market for commercial real estate has also suffered in the
recession. Commercial real estate encompasses a wide range of properties,
from small businesses that occupy a single stand-alone structure to large
shopping malls owned by a consortium of investors.
Problems in the commercial real estate sector are less obviously a result
of overbuilding than those in the residential sector; instead, they reflect the
sharp decline in demand for commercial space and the overall decline in the
economy. The value of commercial real estate increased notably between
2005 to 2007, spurred by easy credit conditions, as measured for example in
the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey. By the end of 2004, the net number
of banks reporting they had eased lending standards for commercial real
estate loans was persistently larger than at any point in the history of the
series. Most banks did not begin tightening standards again until the end of
2006. The relative quantity of financing also increased over this period; the
ratio of the change in the value of commercial real estate mortgages to new
construction, which should increase when debt financing becomes relatively
attractive, reached a 45-year high in 2003 and then continued to climb,
peaking at the end of 2005 at more than three times the historical average.2
In the nonresidential sector, high prices did not translate into a
dramatic increase in new construction (Figure 4-7). Rather, existing owners
of nonresidential properties used the cheap financing and price increases
to refinance or sell. Several factors appear to have played a role in limiting
2

The numerator of the ratio is the seasonally adjusted change in commercial and multifamily
residential mortgages (Federal Reserve, Flow of Funds Tables F219 and F220). The denominator
is seasonally adjusted construction of commercial and health care structures, multifamily structures, and miscellaneous other nonresidential structures (Department of Commerce, Bureau of
Economic Analysis, National Income and Product Accounts Table 5.3.5). The median of the
ratio from 1958 to 2000 is 0.46, while the 2005:Q4 value is 1.50.

new investment in this sector. First, a close look at Figure 4-7 shows that
nonresidential construction has historically exhibited much less volatility
than residential construction, a pattern that also held true during the
recent boom. Second, developers seem to have been wary of overbuilding
because of unhappy experiences in previous expansions. A final dampening
factor has been that construction resources were tied up in the residential
construction sector. Indeed, only when residential construction slowed in
2006 did nonresidential construction begin to show larger gains.

Commercial real estate values have declined dramatically since 2007.
As Figure 4-8 shows, according to the Moody’s/REAL Commercial Property
Index, which tracks same-property price changes for commercial office,
apartment, industrial, and retail buildings, commercial real estate prices fell
43 percent from their peak in October 2007 to September 2009. A steep
increase in vacancy rates, stemming from weakness in the overall economy,
has been one important reason for these declines in value: the commercial
real estate services firm CB Richard Ellis reports that vacancy rates for offices
increased from 12.6 percent in mid-2007 to 17.2 percent in the third quarter
of 2009. Before the recession, vacancy rates were generally declining.

As commercial real estate values have declined, owners have found
it difficult to refinance their debt because loan balances now appear large
relative to the properties’ value. Nearly half of the banks responding to the
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey in the third quarter of 2009 reported
that they continued to tighten standards on commercial real estate loans,
whereas none of the respondents reported having eased standards. Since
commercial real estate loans typically are relatively short term, an inability
to refinance debt has led to a sharp rise in delinquencies and foreclosures.
Figure 4-8 shows that the proportion of commercial real estate loans with
payments at least 30 days past due rose from about 1 percent during most
of the decade to almost 9 percent by the third quarter of 2009. Distress has
made lenders reluctant to provide financing for new projects. Overall, the
value of commercial and multifamily residential mortgages declined in each
of the first three quarters of 2009 (Federal Reserve Flow of Funds Tables
L.219 and L.220). Tight credit and the increase in sales of distressed properties have fed into further price declines, generating a negative feedback loop
between property values and conditions in the sector.
As private sources of funding have dried up, the Federal Reserve
has helped fill the gap through the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan
Facility (TALF). In June 2009, the TALF made lending available to private
financial market participants against their holdings of existing commercial

Saving and Investment  |  125

mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), thereby increasing liquidity in the
CMBS market. In November 2009, the TALF made its first loans against
newly issued CMBS. The provision of TALF financing for these newly
issued securities may prove particularly important in allowing borrowers
to refinance.
The negative feedback loop between credit conditions, the sale of
distressed commercial properties, and commercial property values may lead
to further price declines. Eventually, however, a combination of economic
recovery and an improvement in financing conditions should help prices
stabilize. Still, as with the residential mortgage market, commercial real
estate financing will likely not return any time soon to the easy terms
that prevailed before the collapse. Experience in previous business cycles
suggests that recovery of the sector will lag the economy as a whole.

Business Investment
If consumption and construction are not the drivers of growth going
forward in the way they were in the early 2000s, two components of private
demand are left to fill the gap: business investment excluding structures,
and net exports.3 Nonstructures investment could well become again (as it
was in the 1990s) a driving force in the expansion of aggregate demand and
economic production. And in the long run, its share in GDP could reach
levels higher than those of the first part of the decade.

Investment in the Recovery
Investment spending (other than structures) plummeted in late 2008
and early 2009. This investment spending fell so low that, after accounting
for depreciation, estimates of the absolute stock of capital showed stagnation
in 2008 and even a decline in the first quarter of 2009. Falling spending in
this category reflected falling business confidence, as indicated, for example,
in the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Business Outlook Diffusion
Index; this index was negative every month from October 2008 to July
2009, signaling that more businesses thought conditions were deteriorating
than thought they were improving. Similarly, the National Federation of
Independent Business Index of Small Business Optimism hit its lowest point
since 1980 in March 2009.
3

In the National Income and Product Accounts, construction of commercial structures is
classified as part of business investment. Given that the boom and bust were concentrated
in residential and commercial construction, however, for discussing recent and prospective
developments it is more useful to consider commercial construction investment together with
residential investment, as was done in the previous section. Thus, the discussion that follows is
largely concerned with nonstructures investment.

126  |  Chapter 4

Investment of this kind firmed in the second half of 2009, coinciding
with improvements in business confidence. Indeed, investment in equipment and software increased at a 13 percent annual rate in the fourth
quarter. Nevertheless, the cumulative erosion has been so substantial that
years of strong growth will be necessary to fully recover from the nadir.
As a result, recovery of spending in this area is likely to make a substantial
contribution to the recovery of the overall economy.

Investment in the Long Run
In the long run, the share of business investment is likely not just to
return to its pre-recession levels, but to exceed them. During the boom of
the 1990s, the share of business investment in equipment and software as a
fraction of GDP rose from a post-Gulf-War recession low of 6.9 percent in
1991 to 9.6 percent in 2000. During that period, investment in information
processing equipment and software made the largest contribution to the
increase, as shown in Figure 4-9. Information technology (IT) investment
grew an astounding 18 percent per year on average from 1991 to 2000.
Other investment in equipment and software, which includes industrial,
transportation, and construction equipment, accelerated as well, and grew as
a share of GDP over this period. This high level of investment in the 1990s
increased industrial capacity by an average of 4 percent per year.
As the figure shows, the boom came to an end at the beginning of
the 2000s, when investment in every category of equipment and software
fell sharply as a share of GDP. The recovery in business investment in
equipment and software after the 2001 recession was weak. IT investment
grew at a historically tepid pace of 6 percent per year from 2003 to 2007, far
below pre-2000 growth rates. Non-IT investment growth was also muted,
with spending on industrial equipment growing at an annual pace of only
3.7 percent from 2003 to 2007, down from an average of 5.4 percent in the
1990s. Investment in transportation equipment surpassed its 1999 peak
only for one quarter in 2006. In the recovery following the 2001–02 recession, the peak value of non-IT equipment investment as a share of GDP was
only 4.3 percent (in 2006), a level that does not even match the historical
average value of that series in the period from 1980 to 2000. Production
capacity in the sector grew an average of 0.6 percent per year from 2003 to
2007, substantially below the average pace of growth in the 1990s. Taken
as a whole, these figures suggest that business investment may have been
abnormally low over the course of the post-2001 expansion.
There are strong reasons to expect investment’s role in the economy
will be larger in the future. In the long run, the real interest rate will adjust
to bring the demand for the economy’s output in line with the economy’s

capacity. The increase in private saving described in the first part of the
chapter, together with the policies to tackle the long-run budget deficit that
are the subject of the next chapter, should help maintain low real interest
rates. By keeping the cost of investing low, these low real interest rates
should help to encourage investment.
At the same time, other forces should help increase investment at
a given cost of borrowing. A number of promising technological developments offer the prospect that businesses will be able to find many
productive purposes for new investments, ranging from new uses of wireless
electromagnetic spectrum, to new applications of medical and biological
discoveries opened up by DNA sequencing technologies, to environmentally
friendly technologies like new forms of production and distribution of clean
energy (see Chapter 10 for more on these subjects).
Another form of investment is business spending on research and
development (R&D). Such spending can be interpreted as investment in the
accumulation of “knowledge capital.” Ideally, private investments in R&D
will dovetail with complementary public investments in knowledge capital
through basic research and scientific and technological infrastructure. The
Administration’s commitment to fostering the connections between public
and private investments in knowledge production has been strongly signaled
in both the Recovery Act and the President’s fiscal year 2010 budget (Office
of Management and Budget 2009). The Recovery Act included $18.3 billion
128  |  Chapter 4

of direct spending on research, one of the largest direct increases in such
spending in the Nation’s history. In addition, more than $80 billion of
Recovery Act funds were targeted toward technology and science infrastructure. The Administration’s first budget proposed to double the research
spending by three key science agencies: the National Science Foundation,
the Department of Energy’s Office of Science, and the Department of
Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology. And to foster
private sector innovation, the budget also included the full $74 billion cost of
making the research and experimentation tax credit permanent in order to
give businesses the certainty they need to invest, innovate, and grow.
With reduced demand from consumption and housing tending to
make the real interest rate lower than it otherwise would be, and increased
investment demand from the many newly developing technologies and
incentives for R&D, a larger portion of the economy’s output is likely to be
devoted to investment. And, because business investment contributes not
only to aggregate demand but also to aggregate supply and productivity, a
larger role for investment will create a stronger economy going forward.

The Current Account
The picture of future growth in the United States described in the
previous sections depends less on borrowing and consumption than did
growth in the past decade. This view has important implications for our
interactions with other countries and the current account.

Determinants of the Current Account
The current account is the trade balance plus net income on overseas
assets and unilateral transfers like foreign aid and remittances. The trade
balance, or net exports, represents the bulk of the current account and is
responsible for a large majority of short-run movements in it. To a first
approximation, a current account deficit implies that the trade balance is
negative or, equivalently, that our exports are less than our imports. At
the same time, the current account deficit must also be matched by the net
borrowing of the United States from the rest of the world. If we spend more
than we earn, we must borrow the money to do so. In the national income
accounting sense, the definition of the current account can be reduced to
national saving minus investment (plus some measurement error).
This accounting definition provides a description but not an
explanation of the drivers of the current account. One important driver
is the business cycle. As Box 4-1 explains, over the last 30 years, the U.S.
current account deficit tended to be larger when the economy was booming
Saving and Investment  |  129

and unemployment was low. In a boom, investment tends to rise and saving
tends to fall, generating a current account deficit. When the economy
struggles, investment often falls and saving often rises, generating a surplus
(or a smaller deficit). In countries that rely more on exports to drive their
growth, an acceleration in growth can be associated with a rising current
account surplus (or smaller deficit).
Current accounts do not need to be balanced in every country in
every year. At any point in time, countries may offer more investment
opportunities than their desired level of saving at a given interest rate can
fund, making them net borrowers, resulting in a current account deficit.
Other countries may have an excess of saving over desired investment,
making them net lenders (a current account surplus). However, in the

Box 4-1: Unemployment and the Current Account
The relationship between the level of unemployment and the current
account balance is complicated. People frequently argue that imports—
and specifically the current account deficit—displace U.S. workers and
generate higher unemployment. However, the main determinant of
unemployment in the short and medium runs is the state of the business
cycle. The scatter plot of the current account and the unemployment rate
since 1980, shown in the accompanying figure, displays a positive relationship. Historically, a smaller current account deficit has coincided with a
higher unemployment rate. Both were being driven by cyclical economic
factors: in a recession, the current account balance improved, and unemployment was high. In a boom, the current account balance deteriorated,
and unemployment was low. This usual pattern has been at work in
the current recession. The U.S. current account deficit narrowed from
6.4 percent of GDP in the third quarter of 2006 to 2.8 percent of GDP in
the second quarter of 2009. At the same time, unemployment rose from
4.6 percent to 9.3 percent.
The relationship between unemployment and the current account
balance can be different in countries that have relied more heavily on
exports for growth. For example, in Germany, the unemployment rate fell
from 11.7 percent in 2005 to 9.0 percent in 2007 while the current account
surplus rose from 5.1 percent of GDP to 7.9 percent. Likewise, in Japan,
unemployment fell from 2005 to 2007 as the current account surplus
rose. Given the slack in the U.S. economy, a shift toward a current
account surplus could increase aggregate demand and help lower the
unemployment rate.

long run, current accounts should tend toward balance, thereby allowing
the net foreign investment position (total foreign assets minus total foreign
liabilities) of borrowing nations to at least stabilize as a ratio to GDP and
possibly to decline over time. Otherwise, creditor nations would be continually increasing the share of their wealth held as assets of debtor nations, and
debtor nations would owe a larger and larger share of their production to
foreign lenders and capital owners.
Thus, in the long run, one would expect the U.S. current account to
move toward balance. As it does so, it will not cause the absolute level of
our accumulated net foreign debt to decline unless the U.S. current account
moves into surplus (which is of course possible). But, even if the longrun current account is merely in balance or a small deficit, the previous
net foreign borrowing should still decline as a share of GDP as GDP rises.
Further, so-called “valuation effects”—changes in asset values of foreign
assets held by Americans or U.S. assets owned by foreign investors—also
affect the ratio of foreign indebtedness to GDP.

Saving and Investment  |  131

The Current Account in the Recovery and in the Long Run
As the U.S. economy recovers from the current crisis, it is unlikely to
return to current account deficits as large as those in the mid-2000s. Coming
out of the 2001–02 recession, investment rose more quickly than saving, and
the current account deficit widened to more than 6 percent of GDP (Figure
4-10). Investment had also declined slightly more than saving had before
the current crisis hit, and the current account deficit moderated to less than
5 percent of GDP by the third quarter of 2007.4 The gap narrowed rapidly as
investment fell sharply during the crisis. The increase in the personal saving
rate since the onset of the crisis has partly offset the large Federal budget
deficit (which is negative government saving), so the current account deficit
shrank to under 3 percent of GDP.
The specific path of the current account as the economy exits the
crisis will depend on whether government and private saving rise ahead of,
or along with, a rebound in private investment. But in the long run, the
current account deficit is likely to be smaller than it was before the crisis.
The likely rise in private and public saving relative to their pre-crisis levels

There is also a statistical discrepancy between the saving-minus-investment gap and the current
account. While this discrepancy is generally close to zero, it moved from slightly negative to
slightly positive in this period, so that the measured current account moved more than the
measured gap between saving and investment did.

132  |  Chapter 4

implies an increase in national saving. Thus, saving is likely to more closely
balance domestic investment, suggesting a transition to a smaller current
account deficit than in the 2000s. Given that the current account deficit has
already narrowed to roughly 3 percent of GDP—less than half its peak—the
crucial challenge will be to avoid a reversion to a high-spending, low-saving
economy. A successful shift toward a more balanced world growth model
generated by increased consumption in nations with current account
surpluses could improve net exports even more. This could bring the
current account deficit toward its mid-1990s level of roughly 1 to 2 percent
of U.S. GDP.
Exports can be expected to rise rapidly as the world economy recovers
for a number of reasons. Just as trade typically falls faster than GDP in a
recession (discussed in Chapter 3), it typically grows faster during a rebound.
Trade-to-GDP ratios have fallen in the last year and can be expected to
bounce back as the world economy recovers. This bounce-back alone will
lead to rapid export growth. More generally, the crucial driver of exports is
always the performance of the world economy. For U.S. goods and services
to be bought abroad, demand in other countries must return robustly. This
is one reason for the United States to strengthen its ties with fast-growing
regions such as emerging East Asia. The faster our trade partners grow and
the more we trade with fast-growing economies, the more demand for U.S.
exports grows. Figure 4-11 shows the historical relationship between U.S.
export growth and growth of non-U.S. world GDP.
The rebalancing of the U.S. economy is likely to be accompanied by a
rebalancing of the world economy as well. It is reasonable to expect growth
in East Asia to continue at a rapid rate but also to become more oriented
toward domestic consumption and investment than it has been in the recent
past. Some nations with large current account surpluses took steps to
increase domestic demand during the crisis, and these efforts must be maintained and expanded if world growth is to rebalance. It is not a given that
such a transition in world demand will take place. Concerted policy action
will be needed, but if saving falls in countries with current account surpluses
and spending rises, that should stimulate U.S. exports as well as take
pressure off of the U.S. consumer as an engine of world growth.

Steps to Encourage Exports
The Administration is taking many concrete steps to encourage
exports. The Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee brings government agencies together to help firms export. While the final decision of
whether and how much to export is a market decision made by private
businesses, the government can play a constructive role in many ways. The

Export-Import Bank can help with financing; consular offices can provide
contacts, information, and advocacy; Commerce Department officials can
help firms negotiate hurdles; a combination of agencies can help small and
mid-sized businesses explore overseas markets. Much of the academic
literature in trade models a firm’s decision to export as involving a substantial one-time fixed cost (Melitz 2003). The Administration is doing all that
it can to lower that initial fixed cost to help expand exports.
In addition, the Administration is pursuing possible trade agreements
and making the most of its current trade agreements to expand opportunities for American firms to export. Because U.S. trade barriers are relatively
low, new trade agreements often lower barriers abroad more than in the
United States, opening new paths for U.S. exports. As the Administration
works to expand U.S. market access through a world trade agreement in the
Doha round of multilateral trade talks, it continues to explore its options in
bilateral free trade agreements and regional frameworks, such as the TransPacific Partnership. The United States Trade Representative continues
to work through previously negotiated trade agreements to lower nontariff trade barriers and facilitate customs issues to make it easier for U.S.
businesses to export.
134  |  Chapter 4

Not all of these developments will necessarily increase net exports
(or the current account) of the United States. Since the current account
equals net lending to or borrowing from the world, moving the current
account balance requires adjustments in saving and investment as well as
more opportunities to export. In the long run, increases in demand for
U.S. exports resulting from export promotion or reduced trade barriers will
generate higher standards of living, but through improved terms of trade,
not an increase in net exports. Further, the simple recovery of world trade
volumes will increase exports and imports alike. As discussed in Chapter
10, this increase in trade can increase productivity and living standards, but
it will not change the current account. However, rapid world growth and
declining current account surpluses abroad should lead to an increase in
U.S. exports. This can help increase U.S. net exports and hence contribute
to the recovery.
As with higher investment, lower current account deficits have
important long-run benefits. Lower foreign indebtedness than the country
otherwise would have had means reduced interest payments to foreigners.
Equivalently, it means that foreigners have on net smaller claims on the
output produced in the United States. Thus, lower current account deficits
will raise standards of living in the long run.

Conclusion
Economic policy should not aim to return the economy to the path of
unstable, unsustainable, unhealthy growth it was on before the wrenching
events of the past two years. We should—and can—achieve something
better. Growth that is not fueled by unsustainable borrowing, and growth
that is based on productive investments, is more stable than the growth of
recent decades. And growth that is associated with higher saving will lead
to greater accumulation of wealth, and so greater growth in our standards
of living.

ADDRESSING THE LONG-RUN
FISCAL CHALLENGE

A

fter several years of budget surpluses, the Federal Government began
running consistent, substantial deficits in the 2002 fiscal year. Because
the deficits absorbed a significant portion of private saving, they were one
reason that the economic expansion of the 2000s was led by consumption
and foreign borrowing rather than investment and net exports. More troubling than the deficits of the recent past, however, is the long-term fiscal
outlook the Administration inherited. Even before the increased spending
necessary to rescue and stabilize the economy, the policy choices of the
previous eight years and projected increases in spending on health care and
Social Security had already put the government on a path of rising deficits
and debt. Thus, a key step in rebalancing the economy and restoring its
long-run health must be putting fiscal policy on a sound, sustainable footing.
This chapter discusses the fiscal challenges the Administration
inherited, the dangers posed by large and growing deficits, and the
Administration’s measures and plans for addressing these challenges. The
Administration and Congress are already taking important steps, most
notably through their efforts toward comprehensive health care reform. The
legislation currently under consideration addresses rapidly rising health care
costs, which are one of the central drivers of the long-run fiscal problem.
The fiscal problem is multifaceted, however, and was decades in the making.
As a result, no single step can fully address it. Much work remains, and
bipartisan cooperation will be essential.

The Long-Run Fiscal Challenge
When President Obama took office in January 2009, fiscal policy was
on a deteriorating course. Figure 5-1 shows the grim outlook for the budget
projected by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) under the assumption

137

that the policies then in effect would be continued.1 As the figure makes
clear, the budget was on an unsustainable trajectory.

Medicare’s physician payment rates, and holding other discretionary outlays constant as a
share of GDP.
Sources: Congressional Budget Office (2009a, 2009f).

The figure shows that CBO projected that the deficit would be
severely affected in the short run by the economic crisis. The decline
in output was projected to send tax revenues plummeting and spending
for unemployment insurance, nutritional assistance, and other safety net
programs soaring. As a result, the deficit was projected to spike to 9 percent
of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2009 before falling as the economy
recovered. It is natural for revenues to decline and government spending
to rise during a recession. Indeed, these movements both mitigate the
recession and cushion its impact on ordinary Americans.

This figure presents the CBO January 2009 baseline budget outlook through 2019, adjusted to
reflect CBO’s estimates of the cost of extending expiring tax provisions including the 2001 and
2003 tax cuts and indexing the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) for inflation, reducing the
number of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan to 75,000 by 2013, modifying Medicare’s “sustainable growth rate” formula to avoid scheduled cuts in physician payment rates, holding other
discretionary outlays constant as a share of gross domestic product, and the added interest costs
resulting from these adjustments (Congressional Budget Office 2009a). After 2019, the figure
presents CBO’s June 2009 Long-Term Budget Outlook alternative fiscal scenario, which also
reflects the costs of continuing these policies (Congressional Budget Office 2009f).

138  |  Chapter 5

The key message of the figure, however, concerns the path of the
deficit after the economy’s projected recovery from the recession. The
deficit was projected to fall to close to 4  percent of GDP in 2012 as the
economy recovers, but then to reverse course, rising steadily by about
1 percent of GDP every two years. Figure 5-2 shows that if that path were
followed, the ratio of the government’s debt to GDP would surpass its level
at the end of World War II within 20 years, and would continue growing
rapidly thereafter. At some point along such a path, investors would no
longer be willing to hold the government’s debt at any reasonable interest
rate. Thus, such a path is not feasible indefinitely.

Sources of the Long-Run Fiscal Challenge
The challenging long-run budget outlook the Administration
inherited has two primary causes: the policy choices of the previous eight
years and projected rising spending on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social
Security. The policy choices under the previous administration contribute
a substantial amount to the high projected deficits as a share of GDP, while
rising spending for health care and Social Security is the main reason the

Addressing the Long-Run Fiscal Challenge  |  139

deficits are projected to balloon over time. Both make large contributions to
the difficult fiscal outlook.
The previous policy choices involved both spending and revenues.
On the spending side, two decisions were particularly important. One was
the failure to pay for the addition of a prescription drug benefit to Medicare,
which is estimated to increase annual deficits over the next decade by an
average of one-third of a percent of GDP, excluding interest, and more than
that in the years thereafter (Congressional Budget Office 2009g; Council of
Economic Advisers estimates). The other was the decision to fight two wars
without taking any steps to pay for the costs—costs that so far have come
close to $1 trillion. On the revenue side, the most important decisions were
those that lowered taxes without making offsetting spending cuts. In particular, the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts have helped push revenues to their lowest
level as a fraction of GDP at any point since 1950 (Office of Management
and Budget 2010).
Figure 5-3 shows the impact on the budget deficit of these three major
policies of the previous eight years that were not paid for: the 2001 and
2003 tax cuts (including the increased cost of Alternative Minimum Tax
relief as a result of those tax cuts), the prescription drug benefit, and the
spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan (which for this analysis are
assumed to wind down by 2013), both with and without the interest expense
of financing these policies.2 At their peak in 2007 and 2008, these policies
worsened the government’s fiscal position by almost 4 percent of GDP, and
their effect, including interest, rises above 4 percent of GDP into the indefinite future. The fiscal outlook would be far better if these policies had been
paid for. Indeed, Auerbach and Gale (2009) conclude that roughly half of
the long-run fiscal shortfall in the outlook described earlier results from
policy decisions made from 2001 to 2008.
The other main source of the long-run fiscal challenge is rising
spending on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. These burdens stem
primarily from the rapid escalation of health care costs, combined with
the aging of the population. Annual age-adjusted health care costs per
Medicare enrollee grew 2.3 percentage points faster than the increase in per
capita GDP from 1975 to 2007. If this rate of increase were to continue,
Federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid alone would approach
40 percent of the Nation’s income in 2085, which is clearly not sustainable

The figure shows the annual cost (as a percent of GDP) of supplemental military expenditures for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan through 2009 and CBO’s estimate of the cost of
reducing the number of troops in Iraq and Afghanistan to 75,000 by 2013 thereafter; the cost
of the Medicare Part D program net of offsetting receipts and Medicaid savings; the cost of the
2001 and 2003 tax cuts plus the additional cost of AMT relief associated with those tax cuts, as
estimated by CBO; and the interest expense of financing these policies.

(Congressional Budget Office 2009f). In addition, as a result of decreases in
fertility and increases in longevity, the ratio of Social Security and Medicare
beneficiaries to workers is rising, straining the financing of these programs.
Figure 5-4 projects the growth in spending in Medicare, Medicaid,
and Social Security. Spending on the programs is projected to double as a
share of GDP by 2050. Over the next 20 years, demographics—the retirement of the baby boom generation—is the larger cause of rising spending.
But throughout, rising health care costs contribute to rising spending, and
over the long term, they are by far the larger contributor to the deficit.
Other important factors have also contributed to the increase in
entitlement spending. For example, the fraction of non-elderly adults
receiving Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits has approximately doubled since the mid-1980s, and the fraction of Social Security
spending accounted for by SSDI benefits has increased from 10 to 17 percent.
Beneficiaries of SSDI are also eligible for health insurance through Medicare.
Total cash benefits paid to SSDI recipients were $106 billion in 2008 and an
additional $63 billion was spent on their health care through Medicare. One
contributor to the increase in disability enrollment was a 1984 change in
the program’s medical eligibility criteria, which allowed more applicants to
qualify for benefits in subsequent years (Autor and Duggan 2006).

The potential challenges to the budget from these three entitlement
programs have been clear for decades. Yet, policymakers in previous
administrations did little to address them. For example, in October 2000,
CBO warned that spending on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security
would more than double, rising from 7.5 percent of GDP in 1999 to
over 16.7 percent in 2040; nine years later, their forecast for spending on
these programs remains virtually unchanged (Congressional Budget Office
2000, 2009f).
All told, the Obama Administration inherited a very different budget
outlook from the one left to the previous administration. Figure 5-5
compares the budget forecast in January 2001 (Congressional Budget Office
2001) with the budget outlook in January 2009 described above.3 In 2001,
CBO forecast a relatively bright fiscal future. After a decade of strong
growth and responsible fiscal policy, the budget was substantially in surplus,
and CBO analysts projected rising surpluses over the next decade, even
under their more pessimistic policy alternatives. Rising health care costs
would squeeze the budget only over the long term, and the retirement of the
baby boom generation was still more than a decade away. The intervening
time could have been used to pay off the national debt and accumulate

Budget Outlook (Congressional Budget Office 2000).

substantial assets in preparation. But policymakers chose a different path.
They enacted policies that added trillions to the national debt and doubled
the size of the long-run problem. Combined with a deteriorating economic
forecast and technical reestimates, the result was a much worse budget
outlook in January 2009 than in January 2001.

The Role of the Recovery Act and Other Rescue Operations
One development that has had an important effect on the shortterm budget outlook since January 2009 is the aggressive action the
Administration and Congress have taken to combat the recession. By far
the most important component of the response in terms of the budget is the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Recovery Act cuts
taxes and increases spending by about 2  percent of GDP in calendar year
2009 and by 2¼ percent of GDP in 2010.
Crucially, however, the budgetary impact of the Recovery Act will
fade rapidly. As a result, it is at most a very small part of the long-run fiscal
shortfall. By 2012, the tax cuts and spending under the Recovery Act will
be less than one-third of 1 percent of GDP. Other rescue measures, such as
extensions of programs providing additional support to those most directly
Addressing the Long-Run Fiscal Challenge  |  143

affected by the recession, also contribute to the deficit in the short run.
But these programs are much smaller than the Recovery Act. And like the
Recovery Act, their budgetary impact will fade quickly.
Figure 5-6 shows the overall budgetary impact of the Recovery Act
and other rescue measures, including interest on the additional debt from
the higher short-run deficits resulting from the measures. The impact is
substantial in 2009 and 2010 but then fades rapidly to about one-quarter
of 1 percent of GDP. Moreover, because these estimates do not include
the effects of the rescue measures in mitigating the downturn and speeding
recovery—and thus raising incomes and tax revenues—they surely overstate
the measures’ impact on the budget outlook.

An Anchor for Fiscal Policy
The trajectory for fiscal policy that the Administration inherited,
with budget deficits and government debt growing relative to the size of the
economy, is clearly untenable. Change is essential. But there are many alternatives to the trajectory the Administration inherited. In thinking about
what path fiscal policy should attempt to follow, it is therefore important to
examine how deficits affect the economy and what policy paths are feasible.

144  |  Chapter 5

The Effects of Budget Deficits
Two factors are critical in shaping the economic effects of budget
deficits: the state of the economy, and the size and duration of the deficits.
Consider first the state of the economy. A central lesson of macroeconomics
is that in an economy operating below capacity, higher deficits raise output
and employment. Transfer payments (such as unemployment benefits)
and tax cuts encourage private consumption and investment spending.
Government investments and other purchases contribute to higher output
and employment directly and, by raising incomes, also encourage further
private spending.
In the current situation, as discussed in Chapter 2, monetary
policymakers are constrained because nominal interest rates cannot be
lowered below zero, and so they are unlikely to raise interest rates quickly
in response to fiscal expansion. As a result, the fiscal expansion attributable to the Recovery Act is likely to increase private investment as well as
private consumption and government purchases. Finally, in a precarious
environment like the one of the past year, expansionary fiscal policy may
make the difference between an economy spiraling into depression and one
embarking on a self-sustaining recovery, and so have a dramatic impact
on outcomes. As described more fully in Chapter 2, these benefits of fiscal
expansion were precisely the motivation for the Administration’s pursuit of
the Recovery Act and other stimulus policies over the past year.
When the economy is operating at normal capacity, the effects of
higher budget deficits are very different. In such a setting, the stimulus
from deficits leads not to higher output, but only (perhaps after a delay) to
a change in the composition of output. To finance its deficits, the government must borrow money, competing against businesses and individuals
seeking to finance new productive investments. As a result, deficits drive
up interest rates, discouraging private investment. Hence, deficit spending
diverts resources that would otherwise be invested in productive private
capital—new business investments in plant, equipment, machinery, and
software, or investments in human capital through education and training—
into government purchases or private consumption. To the extent that the
private investments nonetheless occur but are financed by borrowing from
abroad, the country has the benefit of the capital, but at the cost of increased
foreign indebtedness. The result is that Americans’ claims on future output
are lower.
In sum, in normal times, higher budget deficits impede the
rebalancing of output toward investment and net exports described in
Chapter 4; lower deficits contribute to that rebalancing. In addition, budget

Addressing the Long-Run Fiscal Challenge  |  145

deficits were one source of the “global imbalances” discussed in Chapter 3
that have been implicated by some analysts as part of the cause of the financial and economic crisis. Finally, higher budget deficits and the higher levels
of debt they imply may reduce policymakers’ ability to turn to expansionary
fiscal policy in the event of a crisis.
Although determining the impact of large budget deficits on
capital formation and interest rates is a difficult and contentious issue,
the bulk of the evidence points to important effects. For example,
several studies find that increases in projected deficits raise interest
rates (Wachtel and Young 1987; Engen and Hubbard 2005; Laubach
2009). A careful review concludes that the weight of the evidence indicates that budget deficits raise interest rates moderately (Gale and Orszag
2003). Examining the international evidence, another study reaches a
similar conclusion (Ardagna, Caselli, and Lane 2007).
The economic impact of budget deficits depends not only on the
condition of the economy but also on their magnitude and persistence. A
moderate period of large deficits in a weak economy will speed recovery
in the short run and leave the government with only modestly higher debt
in the long run. Even in an economy operating at capacity, a temporary
period of high deficits is manageable, as the experience of World War II
shows compellingly. Once full employment was reached, the high wartime
spending surely crowded out investment and thus caused standards of living
after the war to be lower than they otherwise would have been. But that cost
aside, the enormous temporary deficits that reached 30 percent of GDP at
the peak of the war created no long-run problems.
In contrast, the effects of large deficits and debt that grow indefinitely
and without bound relative to the size of the economy are very different—
and potentially very dangerous. If a government tried to follow such a path,
eventually its debt would exceed the amount investors were willing to hold
at a reasonable interest rate. At that point, the situation would spiral out of
control. Rising interest costs would worsen the fiscal situation; this would
further reduce investors’ willingness to hold the government’s debt, raising
interest costs further; and so on. Eventually, investors would be unwilling to
hold the debt at any interest rate.

Feasible Long-Run Fiscal Policies
Investors have no qualms about holding some government debt.
Indeed, many desire the safety of such an investment. And crucially, in an
economy in which private incomes and wealth, as well as the government’s
tax base, are growing, the amount of debt investors are willing to hold also

146  |  Chapter 5

grows. Thus, the key to a sustainable deficit path is a fiscal policy that keeps
the level of debt relative to the scale of the economy at levels where investors
are willing to hold that debt at a reasonable interest rate. Most obviously,
paths where the ratio of the deficit to GDP and the ratio of the debt to GDP
grow without bound cannot be sustained. Equally, however, paths that
would lead the debt-to-GDP ratio to stabilize, but at an extremely high level,
are also not feasible.
Historical and international comparisons, as well as the very favorable
terms on which investors are currently willing to lend to the United States,
show that the Nation is not close to such problematic levels of indebtedness.
In 2007, before the recession, the debt held by the public was 37 percent of
nominal GDP. In 2015, because of the direct effects of the recession and, to
a lesser extent, the fiscal stimulus, the President’s budget projects the public
debt (net of financial assets held by the government) will be 65 percent of
GDP. By comparison, it was 113 percent of GDP at the end of World War
II; in the United Kingdom, the ratio at the end of World War II was over
250 percent. Table 5-1 shows the projected 2010 government debt-toGDP ratio (including state and local government debt) for a wide range of
developed countries. Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio is 105 percent, Italy’s is
101  percent, and Belgium’s is 85 percent, and all of these are projected to
rise. None of these countries enjoys the same depth and breadth of demand
for its debt as the United States does, yet none has difficulty financing its
debt. Thus, although it is hard to know the exact U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio
that would begin to pose problems, it is clearly well above current levels.

Addressing the Long-Run Fiscal Challenge  |  147

The Choice of a Fiscal Anchor
It is essential that the United States follow a fiscal policy that
stabilizes the debt-to-GDP ratio at a feasible level. In thinking about the
specific level of that ratio that policymakers should aim for, it is useful to
think about the implications that different levels of the budget deficit have
for the level of government debt in the long run. In particular, consider
paths where the deficit as a percent of GDP stabilizes at some level. If the
deficit-to-GDP ratio and the growth rate of nominal GDP are both steady,
the debt-to-GDP ratio will settle down to the ratio of the deficit-to-GDP ratio
to the growth rate of nominal GDP.4 For example, if the deficit is 1 percent
of GDP and nominal GDP is growing at 5 percent per year, the debt-to-GDP
ratio will stabilize at 20 percent. Similarly, if the deficit-to-GDP ratio and
the growth rate of nominal GDP are both 4 percent, the debt-to-GDP ratio
will stabilize at 100 percent. Instead of thinking about various possible longrun targets for the debt-to-GDP ratio, policymakers can consider possible
targets for the deficit-to-GDP ratio and their accompanying implications for
the long-run debt-to-GDP ratio.
The choice among different deficit-to-GDP ratios involves tradeoffs.
Lower deficits, and thus lower debt in the long run, have obvious advantages: a higher capital stock, lower foreign indebtedness, smaller global
imbalances, and more fiscal room to maneuver. But lower deficits have
disadvantages as well. They require smaller government programs, higher
taxes, or both. Because Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will grow
faster than GDP in coming decades even after the best efforts to make those
programs as efficient as possible, significant cuts in government spending
would impose substantial costs. And higher taxes can reduce incentives to
work, save, and invest.
Based on these considerations, the Administration believes that an
appropriate medium-run goal is to balance the primary budget—the budget
excluding interest payments on the debt. Including interest payments,
this target will result in total deficits of approximately 3  percent of GDP.
With real GDP growth of about 2.5 percent per year and inflation of about
4

To see this, consider the case where the deficit-to-GDP ratio equals the growth rate of GDP.
Then the dollar amount of debt issued in a year (that is, the deficit) equals the dollar increase
in GDP. If the debt-to-GDP ratio is 100 percent—the amount of debt outstanding equals
GDP—then the percent increase in debt exactly equals the percent increase in GDP, and the
debt-to-GDP ratio holds steady at 100 percent. If, however, the amount of debt outstanding is
less than nominal GDP, then adding a dollar to the debt results in a larger percentage increase in
the debt than does a dollar added to GDP. Hence, the debt-to-GDP ratio will rise. If the amount
of debt outstanding is more than nominal GDP, then the percent increase in debt is smaller
than the percent increase in GDP and the debt-to-GDP ratio falls. Thus, the debt-to-GDP ratio
converges to the ratio of the deficit-to-GDP ratio to the growth rate of GDP, which in this case
is 100 percent.

148  |  Chapter 5

2 percent per year, nominal GDP growth will be about 4.5 percent per year
in the long run. Thus a target for the total deficit-to-GDP ratio of 3 percent
implies that the debt-to-GDP ratio will stabilize at less than 70  percent.
Because the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to rise to about 65 percent in a
few years, such a target implies that the debt-to-GDP ratio will change little
once the economy has recovered from the current recession. A debt-to-GDP
ratio of around two-thirds is comfortably within the range of historical and
international experience. It represents substantial fiscal discipline relative
to the trajectory the Administration inherited. Stabilizing the ratio rather
than continuing on a path where it is continually growing is imperative, and
stabilizing it at around its post-crisis level has considerable benefits and is a
natural focal point.

Reaching the Fiscal Target
Bringing the primary budget into balance and keeping it there will not
be easy. Noninterest spending outstrips tax revenues by a large margin in
the budget inherited by the Administration. More importantly, the trajectory of policy implied that spending would continue to exceed revenues even
after the economy had recovered and that the deficit would rise steadily for
decades to come. The economic developments and policy decisions that put
fiscal policy on that course took place over many years. Thus, moving policy
back onto a sound path will not happen all at once.

General Principles
In broad terms, the right way to tackle the long-run fiscal problem is
not through a sharp, immediate fiscal contraction, but through policies that
steadily address the underlying drivers of deficits over time. Large spending
cuts or tax increases are exactly the wrong medicine for an economy with
high unemployment and considerable unused capacity: just as fiscal
stimulus raises income and employment in such an environment, mistimed
attempts at fiscal discipline have the opposite effects. Any short-run fiscal
contraction can best be tolerated at a time when the Federal Reserve is no
longer constrained by the zero bound on nominal interest rates, and so has
the tools to counteract any contractionary macroeconomic impacts.
The dangers of a large immediate contraction are powerfully illustrated by America’s experience in the Great Depression. In 1937, after four
years of very rapid growth but with the economy still far from fully recovered,
both fiscal and monetary policy turned sharply contractionary: the veterans’
bonus program of the previous year was discontinued, Social Security taxes
were collected for the first time, and the Federal Reserve doubled reserve
Addressing the Long-Run Fiscal Challenge  |  149

requirements. The consequences of this premature policy tightening were
devastating: real GDP fell by 3 percent in 1938, unemployment spiked from
14 percent to 19 percent, and the strong recovery was cut short.
The impact of actions taken today to gradually bring the long-run
sources of the deficit problem under control would be very different. Such
policies do not involve a sharp short-run contraction that could derail a
nascent recovery. Because the effects cumulate over time, however, they can
have a large effect on the long-term fiscal outlook.
Policies that provide gradual but permanent and growing deficit
reduction have another potential advantage. By improving the outlook
for the long-term performance of the economy, they can improve business
and consumer confidence today. As a result, deficit-improving policies
whose effects are felt mainly in the future can actually boost the economy
in the short run. There is considerable evidence that such “expansionary
fiscal contractions” are not just a theoretical possibility (see, for example,
Giavazzi and Pagano 1990; Alesina and Perotti 1997; Romer and Romer
forthcoming).
In keeping with these general considerations, the Administration is
taking actions in three important areas that will have a material impact on
the deficit in the medium and long terms.

Comprehensive Health Care Reform
The first and single most important step toward improving the
country’s long-run fiscal prospects is the enactment of comprehensive health
care reform that will slow the growth rate of costs. Beyond the obvious
importance for Americans’ well-being and economic security, the health
reform legislation being considered by Congress would save money. The
rapid growth of health care costs is a central source of the country’s fiscal
difficulties. CBO has estimated that both the bill passed by the House in
November 2009 and the bill passed by the Senate in December 2009 would
significantly reduce the deficit over the next decade (Congressional Budget
Office 2009e, 2009d). But the more important factor for the long-run fiscal
situation is that, as discussed in more detail in Chapter 7, the bills contain
crucial measures that experts believe will lead to lower growth in costs
while expanding access to coverage, increasing affordability, and improving
quality. Given the central role of rising health costs in the long-run deficit
projections, these measures would therefore lead to substantial improvements in the budget situation over time.
In November 2009, CBO’s analysis of the Senate health care bill found
that “Medicare spending under the bill would increase at an average annual

150  |  Chapter 5

rate of roughly 6 percent during the next two decades—well below the
roughly 8 percent annual growth rate of the past two decades” (Congressional
Budget Office 2009c). In December, the Council of Economic Advisers
estimated that the fundamental health care reform in the Senate bill would
reduce the annual growth rate of Medicare and Medicaid costs by a full
percentage point below what it would otherwise be in the coming decade,
and by even more in the following decade (Council of Economic Advisers
2009b). These reductions reflect specific measures directed at identifiable
sources of wasteful spending and fraud combined with institutional reforms
that will help counter the forces leading to excessive cost growth.
Such a reduction in the growth rate of health care costs would have
a more profound effect on the long-run fiscal situation of the country than
virtually any other fiscal decision being contemplated today. Even if the
slowdown in cost growth held steady at 1 percentage point annually rather
than rising in the second decade, it would reduce the budget deficit in
2030 by about 2 percent of GDP relative to what it otherwise would be. In
today’s terms, this is equivalent to almost $300 billion per year. Most of
these savings reflect the direct impact of lower health care costs on Federal
spending. To the extent that health care reform also slows the growth of
private sector health insurance costs, which are tax preferred, employees
in the private sector will benefit from higher wages and the Treasury from
increased revenues; this becomes a second source of budget savings. And
these direct savings are magnified by lower interest costs resulting from
the reduced debt accumulation in the years preceding 2030 (Council of
Economic Advisers 2009a). The need to expand coverage would reduce
the overall impact of health care reform on the budget deficit somewhat.
However, these costs of expansion would be more than offset even within
the coming decade. Thereafter, reform will lower the deficit by increasing
amounts over time.

Restoring Balance to the Tax Code
The second major step the Administration is taking to address the
long-run fiscal challenge is restoring balance to the tax code that has been
lost since 2001. The 2001 and 2003 tax cuts disproportionately favored
wealthy taxpayers. According to estimates from the Urban-Brookings Tax
Policy Center (2010), in 2010 the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts will increase the
after-tax income of the poorest 20 percent of the population by 0.5 percent
(about $51), the middle 20 percent by 2.6 percent ($1,023), and the top
1 percent by 6.7 percent ($72,910). About 67 percent of the tax cuts went
to the top 20 percent of taxpayers, and 26  percent to the top 1  percent.

Addressing the Long-Run Fiscal Challenge  |  151

These tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans took place when the incomes
of ordinary Americans were stagnating and inequality was reaching almost
unprecedented levels. In other words, the tax cuts exacerbated the broader
trend rather than mitigated it.
The President has consistently maintained that the tax cuts went too
far in cutting taxes for people making more than $250,000 per year and
that the country could not afford the tax breaks given to that group over
the past eight years. That is why one important plank of his fiscal responsibility framework is to rebalance the tax code, so that it is similar to what
existed in the late 1990s for those making more than $250,000 per year.
Specifically, the Administration has proposed letting the marginal tax rates
on ordinary income and capital gains for people making more than $250,000
per year return to the levels they were in 2000. It has also proposed setting
the tax rate on dividends for high-income taxpayers to the same 20 percent
rate that would apply to capital gains—which is lower than the rate in the
1990s—and letting all other features of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire for
these taxpayers. In addition, it has proposed limiting the rate of deductions
for high-income taxpayers to 28 percent, so that the wealthy do not obtain
proportionately larger benefits from their deductions than other Americans
do. None of these changes would take effect until 2011, so they would not
affect disposable incomes as the economy recovers in 2010. Nonetheless,
they would raise nearly $1 trillion over the next 10 years and even more
over the longer run. Equivalently, they would reduce the budget deficit
by more than 0.5 percent of GDP in the medium run and somewhat more
over time.
As just discussed, most of these changes would merely bring the tax
rates on high-income taxpayers back to their levels in the 1990s. To the
extent that some go further, on balance they are more than offset by the
fact that some common types of income—dividends, for example—will
have rates significantly lower than in the 1990s. Looking at tax policy over
U.S. postwar history more broadly shows even more clearly how moderate
the proposed changes are. Figure 5-7 shows the top marginal tax rates on
ordinary income and capital gains over time and their levels under the
Administration’s proposals. For ordinary income, a top rate of 39.6 percent,
while higher than in the past eight years, is not high compared with the rates
that prevailed during most of the past several decades and even during most
of the Reagan administration. For capital gains, the 20 percent rate is lower
than in many previous periods and is certainly not unusual. And for dividends, the 20 percent rate proposed by the Administration would be lower
than under any other modern president save the last.

Statutory marginal tax rates, however, provide only a partial picture of
how the progressivity of the tax system has changed over time. The number
of tax brackets has declined and the thresholds at which statutory bracket
rates apply have changed; different sources of income, such as capital gains
and dividends, are now treated differently in the tax code and taxed at lower
rates; and exemption amounts and standard deductions have been adjusted.
Moreover, the distribution of income across taxpayers and the composition
of taxpayers’ sources of income have changed significantly over time, making
it difficult to disentangle the effects of statutory changes in the tax system
from economic changes. To illustrate the impact of historical statutory tax
changes in isolation, Figure 5-8 applies the tax rates for each year from 1960
to 2008 to a sample of taxpayers who filed returns in 2005, after adjusting for
average wage growth.5 The purpose is to show both how current taxpayers

tax model. This tax model incorporates the major tax provisions affecting the vast majority of
taxpayers and taxable income, and provides estimates of tax liabilities that closely match the
historical distribution of taxes actually paid. However, the tax calculation ignores certain small
tax provisions and certain accounting changes that broadened the definition of taxable income
over time.

would have fared under the tax rates that applied historically and how the
tax rates that applied to different income groups have changed over time.
This analysis suggests that the effective tax rates that applied to
high-income taxpayers reached their lowest levels in at least half a century in
2008. Under the tax laws that applied from 1960 to the mid-1980s, today’s
taxpayers earning more than $250,000 would have paid an average of around
30 percent of their income in Federal income and payroll taxes, with modest
variations from year to year. Moreover, while the tax rates that applied to
these “ordinary” rich have fallen considerably, tax rates for the very rich have
declined much more. Figure 5-8 shows that taxpayers whose real incomes
put them in the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers today—the one-in-a-thousand
taxpayers with incomes above about $2 million in 2009 dollars—would have
paid more than 50 percent of their incomes in taxes in the early 1960s.
Average tax rates on high-income groups fell precipitously in the
mid-1980s, with the sharp decline in statutory marginal rates. At the
same time, the tax rates that would have applied to today’s middle-income
taxpayers (the middle 20 percent of taxpayers in 2005, those making between
about $29,500 and $49,500 per year) increased, on balance, over the last half
century. The result is a compression in the tax burdens applied to taxpayers

154  |  Chapter 5

with different incomes—the difference between the average tax rates on
high-income groups and those on middle-class households is narrower than
at any other time in modern history. All told, because of legislative changes
in the tax code, the after-tax income of the very-high-income group—their
disposable income and purchasing power—is more than 50 percent higher
than it would have been under historical tax rates and brackets, while that of
the middle class is slightly lower.
Under the Administration’s proposals, tax rates on taxpayers earning
more than $250,000 would be very close to the levels that prevailed in the
1990s, leaving statutory tax rates on higher-income taxpayers far below the
levels that prevailed until the mid-1980s. The rebalancing of the tax code
would not affect middle-class taxpayers—except, of course, to the extent
that a better fiscal picture enhances medium- and long-term prospects for
economic growth.
 The need to restore balance is also evident in our corporate tax system,
which encourages businesses to move jobs overseas and to transfer profits
to tax havens abroad in order to avoid taxes at home.  The Administration’s
plan to reform international tax laws would reduce these incentives.
Balance also requires that the largest and most highly levered financial
firms reimburse taxpayers for the extraordinary assistance provided to them
through the Troubled Asset Relief Program.  The President has proposed
a modest Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee to ensure that the cost of the
financial rescue is not borne by taxpayers.  Moreover, the fee would provide
a deterrent against the excessive leverage that helped contribute to the crisis.

Eliminating Wasteful Spending
The third step the Administration is taking to confront the long-term
deficit is cutting unnecessary spending. The President pledged to eliminate programs that are not working. Last year, the Administration either
proposed or enacted cuts to 121 specific programs; these proposed cuts
totaled $17 billion in the first year and hundreds of billions of dollars over
the 10-year budget window. They include billions of dollars in terminations
of defense programs such as the F-22 fighter aircraft and the new Presidential
helicopter, cuts in subsidies for large, high-income agribusinesses, and
more than $40 billion in savings over the next 10 years from eliminating
unnecessary subsidies to financial institutions in the private student
loan market.
In its fiscal 2011 budget, the Administration is proposing another
important measure for spending restraint: a three-year freeze in all nonsecurity discretionary spending starting in 2011. The freeze would be a tough

Addressing the Long-Run Fiscal Challenge  |  155

measure of shared sacrifice. By 2013, it would reduce overall nonsecurity
funding by $30 billion per year relative to current inflation-adjusted funding
levels.
The President also strongly supports restoring the pay-as-you-go
requirement (PAYGO) that was in place in the 1990s.  This law, which
requires that lawmakers make the tough choices needed to offset the costs of
new nonemergency spending or tax changes, helped move the government
budget from deficit to surplus a decade ago.  PAYGO is an important tool to
force the government to live within its means and move the budget toward
fiscal sustainability.
These measures mean that once the temporary rise in government
spending necessitated by the economic crisis has ended, spending will be on
a lower path than it otherwise would have been. Moreover, both the multiyear freeze and steps to identify additional unnecessary spending each year
make the reduction gradual rather than sudden. As a result, the cumulative
reduction is substantial, yet there is never a sudden, potentially disruptive
drop in spending.

Conclusion: The Distance Still to Go
The actions the Administration has taken and is proposing would
reduce deficits by more than $1 trillion over the next 10 years and by even
more after that. These actions are significantly bolder steps toward deficit
reduction than any taken in decades, and they will face serious opposition by
those with vested interests. Even with these actions, however, the primary
budget is forecast to remain in deficit in 2015. And the longer-run fiscal
problem facing the country still centers on the growth of health care costs
and the aging of the population. Thus, barring a substantial and sustained
quickening of economic growth above its usual trend rate, further steps will
be needed to get the deficit down to the target in the medium and long run.
Regardless of the form they take, these additional steps to reduce
the deficit will involve sacrifices by a broad range of groups and significant
compromise. Thus, a bipartisan effort will be essential. That is why the
President is issuing an executive order creating a bipartisan fiscal commission to report back with a package of measures for additional deficit
reduction. The charge to the commission is to propose both medium-term
actions to close the gap between noninterest expenditures and tax revenues
and additional steps to address the longer-term issues associated with rising
health care costs, the aging of the population, and the persistent deficit.
The commission’s recommendations will form an important foundation on
which to base policy decisions moving forward.

156  |  Chapter 5

The Administration understands that addressing the long-run fiscal
challenge will be a long and difficult task requiring commitment and shared
sacrifice. But the President also believes that Americans deserve for and
expect policymakers to deal with the ever-rising deficit. The changes eventually enacted will be central to the long-run preservation of both America’s
financial strength and the standards of living of ordinary Americans.

BUILDING A SAFER
FINANCIAL SYSTEM

F

rom the ashes of the Great Depression, our leaders built a national system
of financial regulation. Before 1933, there was no national regulator for
stock and bond markets, no required disclosure by public firms, no national
oversight of mutual funds or investment advisors, no insurance for bank
depositors, and few restrictions on the activities of banks or other financial
institutions. By 1940, landmark legislation had created the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, new
and important powers for the Federal Reserve, and disclosure requirements
for virtually every major player in financial markets. The pieces of this regulatory structure fit together in a relatively cohesive whole, and the United
States enjoyed a long period of relative financial calm. In the 60 years before
the Great Depression, our Nation experienced seven episodes of financial
panic, in which many banks were forced to shut their windows and declined
to redeem deposit accounts. In the nearly 80 years since the Depression, not
a single financial crisis has risen to that level.
Although the system of regulation put together during the Depression
served us well for many years, warning signs appeared periodically. The
savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s showed how
banking regulation itself can have unintended consequences. At that time,
deregulation coupled with generous deposit insurance combined to create
a dangerous pattern of risk-taking that eventually led to a large Federal
bailout of the financial system. In 1998, the collapse of Long-Term Capital
Management highlighted gaps in the regulatory structure and induced the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York to organize an unprecedented private
rescue of an unregulated hedge fund. In 2001, the collapse of Enron laid bare
the complexity of the financial operations at seemingly nonfinancial corporations and posed new challenges for accountants, policymakers, and analysts.
Regulatory changes in the past 30 years responded to the specific weaknesses
demonstrated by these crises, but these changes were incremental and lacked
159

a strategic plan. Throughout this period, the architecture created after the
Great Depression was becoming increasingly inadequate to handle ongoing
financial innovation. It was in this vacuum that financial innovation accelerated during the first decade of the 21st century.
The weaknesses in our outdated regulatory system nearly drove
our economy into a second Great Depression. After the bankruptcy of
Lehman Brothers in September 2008, credit markets froze and the Federal
Government was forced to embark on increasingly aggressive intervention
in financial markets. But as bad as the situation was, it could have been
much worse. Courage and creativity during the depths of the crisis, and
forceful stewardship by the Administration in the aftermath, have enabled
our Nation to escape a second Great Depression. Chapter 2 of this report
discusses the major elements of the Administration’s recovery plan. This
chapter focuses on the long-term changes necessary to prevent future crises.

What Is Financial Intermediation?
Suppose that the world woke up tomorrow to find all the banks gone,
along with insurance companies, investment banks, mutual funds, and all
the other institutions where ordinary people put their savings. What would
happen? In the short run, people could keep their savings in mattresses
and piggy banks, and the only apparent losses would be the forgone interest
and dividends. But with no easy way to get the savings from piggy banks
into productive investment, the economy would face bigger problems very
quickly. Entrepreneurs with ideas would find it difficult to get capital. Large
companies in need of money to restructure their operations would have no
way to borrow against their future earnings. Young families would have
no way to buy a house until they had personally saved enough to afford
the whole thing. Our system of financial intermediation makes possible all
those activities, and the infrastructure to perform that function is necessarily
complex and costly.

The Economics of Financial Intermediation
Figure 6-1 is a simplified diagram of the main function of financial
intermediation: transforming savings into investment. The ultimate source
of funds is shown on the left: individuals and institutions that have the final
claim on wealth and wish to save some of it for the future. The ultimate use
of funds is shown on the right: the productive activities that need funds for
investment. The middle of the diagram can be classified as “financial intermediation.” Financial intermediation uses either markets (like the stock
market) or institutions (like a bank) to channel savings into investment.
160  |  Chapter 6

In each of these cases, financial intermediaries provide three important
services: information production, liquidity transformation, and diversification. The paragraphs that follow use a concrete investment example to
explain these services and define the terms used in the figure.

wealthy individual with savings (left side of figure) and ask for an investment
in his company. The potential investor would immediately face two difficult
problems. The first is that she does not know the quality of the entrepreneur’s idea. The entrepreneur is likely to know much more about the science
than does the potential investor. Maybe the entrepreneur has already asked
more than 100 potential investors and been turned down by all of them.
Maybe he knows that the idea has little chance of commercial success but
wants to try anyway for humanitarian reasons. The investor knows none of
these things and cannot learn about them without putting in real effort. In
this case, there would be asymmetric information between the investor and
the entrepreneur at the time of the potential investment: economists call this
a problem of adverse selection.
The second problem faced by the investor is that, after she makes the
investment, she needs some way to monitor the entrepreneur and make sure
he is using the money in the most efficient way. Perhaps the entrepreneur
Building a Safer Financial System  |  161

will decide to use the money for some other business or research purpose.
How will the investor know? Even worse, what is to prevent the entrepreneur from using the funds for his personal benefit or taking the money
without putting in any effort? In this case, there would be additional asymmetric information introduced after the investment was made: economists
call this a problem of moral hazard.
To solve these adverse selection and moral hazard problems, the
investor will need to expend some resources. She will need to study the
technology, evaluate its chances for scientific and commercial success, and
then carefully watch over the entrepreneur after the investment is made.
These activities are difficult and costly, and there is no reason to believe that
a typical source of funds (whose main qualification is that she has money to
invest) would also be the best person to solve these problems. One important
service of financial intermediation is to efficiently solve the adverse selection
and moral hazard problems that come with the transformation of savings into
investment. This chapter refers to this service as information production.
The second main service of financial intermediation is liquidity transformation. Consider how long it takes to develop a cancer treatment. In
the United States, all new drug treatments must pass through a complex
regulatory review stretched over many years. Even if a drug is eventually
approved, the path to commercial success can take many more years. Most
investors do not want to wait that long to see any return on their money.
Individual investors have uncertain liquidity needs—jobs can be lost, family
members can get sick—and even institutional investors are subject to performance evaluation over short periods. Overall, investment projects tend to
have long production times, while investment sources prefer to have easy
access to their money. Somebody, somewhere, must be willing to absorb
the liquidity needs of the economy. In practice, these needs are provided by
liquidity transformation: financial institutions and markets transform longterm (illiquid) investment projects into short-term (liquid) claims.
Liquidity transformation is also important for another, more
worrisome, reason: it is the main source of the fragility that can lead to
a financial crisis. Because most intermediaries have illiquid assets and
liquid liabilities, any broad-based attempt by creditors to call liabilities at
the same time creates an impossible situation for the intermediary. The
classic example is a bank run, where holders of deposits (liquid liabilities)
all “run” at the same time to withdraw their funds, leaving banks unable to
sell the illiquid business loans and mortgages quickly enough to meet these
demands. The same process can occur in a wide variety of nonbank institutions, as is discussed at length later in this chapter.

162  |  Chapter 6

The third main service of financial intermediation is diversification.
A single investment project can be very risky. In the case of the drug
company, no investor would want her entire net worth riding on the success
of just one technological project. Individual investors can minimize their
risk by purchasing a diversified portfolio of investments. If, for example, an
investor could pay 1 percent of the costs for 100 different drug-development
projects, then her overall portfolio risk would be greatly reduced. Further
diversification is achieved by dedicating only a small share of a portfolio to
any given industry or country. Such diversification is a main service of most
financial institutions, which take funds from many small sources and then
invest across a wide variety of projects.

Types of Financial Intermediaries

sector. All of these financial data are from the Federal Reserve’s Flow of
Funds.
These figures show several important trends. First, assets in the
financial sector have grown much faster than GDP: from 1952 to 2009,
nominal GDP grew by 4,000 percent and financial sector assets grew by
16,000 percent. This trend is important to remember in considering the
regulation of finance. It would be helpful to know if the ratio of financial
assets to GDP is “too big” or “too small,” but no good evidence permits such
a conclusion. Furthermore, modern developments in the financial system
have allowed each dollar of underlying assets to multiply many times across
an increasing chain of financial intermediation, so that any measurement of
gross assets (as in Figure 6-2) is misleading as a measure of the “importance”
of the financial sector. The concept of increasing intermediation chains is
discussed later for specific institutional types.
A second important trend is that the assets held by banks grew at
approximately the same rate as GDP. Nevertheless, because the overall size
of the financial sector has increased, the percentage of financial sector assets
held by banks has fallen over time. Third, Figure 6-3 shows the rising share
of assets held by mutual funds, government sponsored enterprises (GSEs)
and federally related mortgage pools, and issuers of asset-backed securities.
Some of this growth can be attributed to the lengthening of the financial
intermediation chain, as pension funds delegate asset management to
164  |  Chapter 6

mutual funds, banks sell mortgages to mortgage pools, and money-market
funds purchase securities from these pools.
Three long-standing institutional types are banks, securities firms,
and insurance companies. Banks, including commercial banks, bank
holding companies, savings institutions (thrifts), and credit unions, are
still the largest component of the financial sector, with $16.5 trillion in
assets as of June 2009. Although bank assets represent 26.7 percent of the
financial sector, their share has fallen precipitously since 1952, when it was
53.2 percent. Securities firms, also known as investment banks or brokerdealers, had $2.0 trillion in assets, comprising 3.2 percent of the sector in
June 2009. This percentage was down considerably from an average of
5.1 percent in 2007, because most of the largest securities firms went
bankrupt, were acquired by banks, or formally converted to banks during
the crisis. Insurance companies have $5.9 trillion in assets, comprising
9.5 percent of the sector as of June 2009.
Mutual funds and pension funds are a second layer of intermediation, often standing in between investors and another institution or market.
Mutual funds had $9.7 trillion in assets, comprising 15.7 percent of the
sector, in June 2009, up from only 1.6 percent in 1952 and 3.1 percent in
1980. Mutual funds take money from retail investors and invest in public
securities. An important subgroup of mutual funds are money-market
funds (MMFs), which are broken out separately in these figures and in the
underlying Federal Reserve data. In 1990, MMFs held less than $500 billion
in assets; by June 2009, their total assets were $3.6 trillion, comprising
5.8 percent of total financial assets. MMFs invest only in relatively safe,
short-term assets. Pension funds are a large and growing share of the sector,
with assets of $8.3 trillion making up 13.5 percent of total financial assets
in June 2009. Many pension assets are reinvested in mutual funds, so they
show up twice in the overall totals. Thus, some of the growth in overall
sector assets is driven by this extra step of intermediation.
The next category in Figure 6-2 is GSEs and federally related mortgage pools, with $8.4 trillion in assets in June 2009. Beginning in the 1930s,
various nonbank sources emerged to buy mortgages on the secondary
market. By the end of the 1970s, federally related mortgage pools—which
include those established by GSEs known as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—
had almost $100 billion in assets. The growth of GSEs added an extra layer to
the financial intermediation of mortgages. Here, the bank provides a loan to
a borrower but then resells this loan to a GSE. The bank may hold debt securities issued by the GSE, and the GSE creates a pool that holds the mortgage.
In addition to those created by GSEs, private mortgage pools, focusing
on “subprime” borrowers, have grown substantially in the past 10 years.
Building a Safer Financial System  |  165

These private mortgage pools issue securities backed by the mortgages; these
securities, known as mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), are purchased and
held by mutual funds or other financial intermediaries. They are one type
of an asset-backed security managed by an ABS issuer. ABS issuers do not
confine themselves to mortgages; they also pool and securitize auto loans,
student loans, credit card debt, and many other types of debt. Twenty years
ago, few ABS issuers existed, but by June 2009 they held $3.8 trillion in assets
and comprised 6.2 percent of total financial sector assets.
The remaining categories in Figures 6-2 and 6-3 are the monetary
authority (the Federal Reserve) and “other.” As discussed in Chapter 2,
the assets of the monetary authority increased rapidly during the crisis, but
the increase is expected to be reversed as the Federal Reserve exits from
its emergency programs and begins reducing the large stock of long-term
securities it had purchased. The “other” category includes special purpose
vehicles created to manage the emergency lending programs and various
other minor groups of intermediaries.
Hedge funds are an increasingly important financial intermediary,
but they are not included in Figures 6-2 and 6-3. Because of a lack of data
on domestic hedge funds, the Federal Reserve classifies such funds as part
of the household sector and computes the assets of this sector as a residual
after everything else is added together and subtracted from total assets. The
Federal Reserve is unable to get a clean number for hedge funds because they
are largely unregulated private investment pools that are not required to
report their holdings to any official source. Unofficial sources estimate the
amount of assets held by hedge funds to have been $1.7 trillion in 2008, but
in the absence of regulatory oversight, this estimate is less reliable than the
other totals shown in Figure 6-2 (Hedge Fund Research 2009).

The Regulation of Financial Intermediation
in the United States
Private institutions and markets should clearly play the central role in
financial intermediation. But government also has a role. Economists generally favor government regulation of markets that exhibit a market failure of
some kind. This chapter has already discussed two types of market failure:
adverse selection and moral hazard. Both can be classified as special cases
of asymmetric information, where different parties to a contract do not have
the same information. The financial intermediation system alleviates asymmetric-information problems between savers and investors, but information
can also be asymmetric between buyers and sellers of financial services.
Just as physicians almost always know more than patients about medicine,
166  |  Chapter 6

and lawyers more than their clients about law, banks and financial advisors
should be expected to know more than their investors about investment
opportunities. For this reason, there will always be a consumer protection
basis for some government regulation of financial services.
Consumer protection was an important motivation for several important pieces of Depression-era legislation. The first two, the Securities Act of
1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, set forth a long list of requirements for issuing and trading public securities. The list included many types
of public disclosure that persist to this day, including information about
executive compensation, stockholdings, balance sheets, and income statements. The 1934 Act also created the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), the agency responsible for enforcing the new rules. These securities
laws were the first Federal laws to regulate organized financial exchanges.
With regulated markets came the growth of intermediaries to service
them. These intermediaries gained Federal oversight with the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 (for publicly available investment advisory services)
and the Investment Company Act of 1940 (for mutual funds). In total, these
four pieces of legislation enacted between 1933 and 1940 represented a huge
change in the regulatory structure of financial markets and in most cases can
be considered attempts to lessen adverse selection and moral hazard problems between investors, intermediaries, and investments.
Depression-era laws also strengthened the national system of bank
regulation, adding new elements to a long pre-Depression history of
Federal regulation. Beginning with the National Bank Act of 1864, federally
chartered banks have been examined regularly for capital adequacy. Statechartered banks received similar examinations from both state and Federal
banking agencies. Such examinations are a form of microprudential regulation, with a focus on the safety and soundness of individual institutions in
isolation and with the aim of reducing asymmetric-information problems.
Few bank depositors have the time or incentive to conduct detailed reviews
of their banks. When regulators conduct periodic reviews and publicize
the results, they create a public good of information about the safety and
soundness of individual banks. Furthermore, examinations and regulations
can constrain excessive risk-taking by federally insured institutions, a moral
hazard problem faced by the government, rather than by bank depositors, in
part because of deposit insurance.
The microprudential approach, however, is not well suited to handle
risks to the entire financial system. The next section of this chapter discusses
in detail the spread of crises. For now, it is sufficient to think of a crisis as
an occasion when there is a sudden increase in the asymmetric-information
problem in the financial system, as can happen after a large economic shock
Building a Safer Financial System  |  167

or the failure of a major bank. The microprudential system of bank examination can alleviate asymmetric-information problems in normal times, but
because the government relies on careful periodic examinations, staggered
across banks, it does not have the capacity to examine all banks quickly after
a shock or to evaluate the risk that a single bank failure will have on other
institutions. Faced with a large economic shock, bank customers can rationally fear for the safety of their deposits. Since the upside of leaving one’s
money at a bank in such a situation is relatively small, but the downside—
losing all one’s money—is large, it is individually rational for depositors
to withdraw their money when uncertainty increases. What is rational
for individual depositors, however, puts an impossible strain on the whole
banking system, since the liquidity transformation performed by banks
cannot be quickly reversed; the illiquid loans and mortgages held by banks
cannot immediately be returned to all depositors as cash.
One partial solution to the liquidity problem during banking crises
is to create a “lender of last resort.” This lender stands ready to make cash
loans to banks that are backed by illiquid collateral: essentially, this lender
serves as a new layer of liquidity transformation above the banks. This form
of macroprudential policy was the traditional solution to banking crises in
Europe in the 19th century but did not come to the United States until the
Federal Reserve Act of 1913 created the first version of the Federal Reserve
System as a lender of last resort.
But a lender of last resort, by itself, is unable to prevent bank runs
across the entire system. Even illiquid collateral must be given a value by
the lender—by law the Federal Reserve can only make secured loans—and
if the entire system is failing at the same time, there may be no way for a
central bank to estimate reasonable valuations quickly enough. A lender of
last resort is designed to solve liquidity problems, not solvency problems, but
in a severe crisis, these two problems can become inextricably tied together.
(This problem arose during the current crisis, when Lehman Brothers was
unable to provide enough collateral to qualify for sufficient Federal Reserve
loans.) During the Great Depression, some 9,000 bank failures occurred
between 1930 and 1933, well above the number of failures in earlier panics.
Shortly after taking office in 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt gave his first
“fireside chat” and implied a government guarantee for all bank deposits.
The Banking Act of 1933 made the guarantee explicit by creating deposit
insurance through a new agency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC). In the 75 years that followed, the United States averaged fewer than
30 commercial bank failures a year. The FDIC is a crucial piece of macroprudential regulation in that it provides a guarantee to all insured banks,
regardless of the condition of any specific bank. Within the account limits
168  |  Chapter 6

of FDIC insurance, no depositor needs to worry about the soundness of her
bank; thus, the FDIC guarantee eliminates most asymmetric-information
problems that could lead to bank runs.
A constant tension in macroprudential regulation is that the attempt
to prevent bank runs can itself lead to new forms of moral hazard. Because
they have deposit insurance, small depositors no longer need to monitor the
safety of their banks; therefore, unless regulators are watching carefully, the
banks may take excessive risks with no fear of losing deposits. This latent
problem was exacerbated during the 1980s by deregulation in the thrift
industry. Following this deregulation, thrift institutions began aggressively
seeking out deposits by paying ever-higher interest rates and then intermediating these deposits into speculative investments. This strategy allowed
thrifts to use FDIC insurance to gamble for solvency, and when the investments failed, a wave of thrift failures swept through Texas, the Midwest, and
New England in the 1980s and early 1990s. This wave, now known as the
savings and loan crisis, represented the first significant increase in bank failures since the Great Depression. The failures, it should be noted, were not
caused by bank runs—they were not driven by a liquidity mismatch between
deposits and loans. Deposit insurance remained intact, and no insured
deposit lost any money. Rather, the bank failures were caused by the insolvency of the banks, as they gambled and lost with (effectively) government
money. Nevertheless, even in the absence of bank runs, many economists
believe that the savings and loan crisis contributed to the “credit crunch”
and recession of 1990–91.
There has been no fundamental restructuring of the Nation’s financial
regulatory system since the Great Depression. All changes since that time
have been piecemeal responses to specific events, added individually onto
the original superstructure. That regulatory stasis has led to four major
gaps in the current system. First, many of the newer financial institutions—
hedge funds, mortgage pools, asset-backed-securities issuers—have grown
rapidly while being subject to only minimal Federal regulation. These new
institutions suffer from many of the asymmetric-information problems that
banks faced before the Depression-era reforms. Second, overlapping jurisdictions and mandates have led to regulatory competition between agencies
and regulatory “shopping” by institutions. Such competition is yet another
form of moral hazard—now centered on the regulators themselves. Third,
regulators operate separately in functional silos of banking, insurance, and
securities. Many of the largest institutions perform all these activities at once
but are not subject to robust consolidated regulation and supervision. And
finally, most of the regulatory system is microprudential and focused on the
safety and soundness of specific institutions. No regulator is tasked with
Building a Safer Financial System  |  169

taking a macroprudential approach, which attempts to monitor, recognize,
and alleviate risks to the financial system as a whole. Such macroprudential
regulation would require explicit rules for the orderly resolution of all large
financial institutions, not just the banks currently resolved by the FDIC.
In short, because of these four gaps, the failure of one institution imposes
negative externalities on others, and there is no coherent system for fixing
these externalities.
Of the four gaps, the last requires the most urgent reform and the
biggest change in regulatory thinking. The financial crisis made clear how
rapidly failures can spread across institutions and affect the whole system.
A primary challenge of macroprudential regulation is to recognize such
“contagion” and categorize and counteract all the different ways it can
manifest. The next section of the chapter turns to this task.

Financial Crises:
The Collapse of Financial Intermediation
A financial crisis is a collapse of financial intermediation. In a crisis,
the ability of the financial system to move savings into investment is severely
impaired. In an extreme crisis, banks close their doors, financial markets shut
down, businesses are unable to finance their operations, and households are
challenged to find credit. A financial crisis can be triggered by events that
are completely external to the financial system. If a large macroeconomic
shock hits all banks at the same time, regulators can do little to control the
damage. Some crises, however, are triggered or exacerbated by shocks to a
small group of institutions that then spread to others. This spread, known
as contagion, is a form of negative externality imposed by distressed institutions. The recent financial crisis involved three different types of contagion,
referred to in this chapter as confidence contagion, counterparty contagion,
and coordination contagion. A macroprudential regulator must have the
tools to handle all three.

Confidence Contagion
The classic example of a “run on the bank” is shown in Figure 6-4.
Banks are mostly financed by deposits, which are then lent out as loans to
businesses and mortgages for homeowners. A bank’s balance sheet has a
maturity mismatch between assets (the loans) and liabilities (the deposits):
the loans are long term, with payments coming over many years, while the
deposits are short term and can be withdrawn at any time. The liquidity
transformation service of the bank works in ordinary times but breaks down
if all the depositors ask for their money back at the same time.

(Information Asymmetry)

Suppose, for example, a depositor in Bank A hears a rumor that other
depositors in Bank A are withdrawing their funds. He does not know the
explanation. It might be that Bank A has a problem with solvency, that a
fair accounting would show that its liabilities exceed its assets. Typically, a
depositor does not have the necessary information to form an accurate judgment about solvency. So what does he do? The safe thing, in the absence
of deposit insurance, is to go to the bank and take out his money. Perhaps
these other depositors know something that he does not. If he waits too
long, the bank will be out of cash and unable to redeem his account.
It is easy to see how the run at Bank A could lead to runs at other
banks. The public spectacle of long lines of depositors waiting outside a
bank is enough to make other banks’ customers nervous—the negative
externality on confidence. Perhaps Bank A had many real estate loans in
some trouble area, and Bank B has an unknown number of similar loans.
The issue here is that bank depositors do not want to take the risk of leaving
their money in a failing bank. Unlike stock market investors, who expect
to take risks and face complicated problems in forecasting the future path
of company profits, bank depositors want their money to be safe and do
not want to spend an enormous amount of time making sure that it is.
The information production service of banks cannot quickly be replaced
if the bank is in trouble. Banks, therefore, have historically been subject to
runs, and the runs have spread quickly across banks, a phenomenon called
confidence contagion.

Building a Safer Financial System  |  171

Classic bank runs were commonplace in the United States before
(and during) the Great Depression. In the post-FDIC world, bank failure
has become a problem of insolvency, not illiquidity. FDIC insurance works
almost perfectly up to a current limit of $250,000 for each account. What
happens above this limit? What of the many corporations and investors who
want a safe place to put their million-dollar and billion-dollar deposits? In
the absence of insured accounts at this level, they choose such alternatives
as money-market funds, collateralized short-term loans to financial institutions, and complex derivative transactions. In each of these cases, the effort
to find safe, liquid investments can lead to situations that look identical to a
classic bank run, but with different players. When a single investment bank
(Bear Stearns in March 2008) or money-market fund (the Reserve Fund in
September 2008) gets into solvency trouble, confidence can quickly erode at
similar institutions. Macroprudential regulation must stop this confidence
contagion or, at least, contain it to one segment of the financial system.

Counterparty Contagion
Counterparty contagion is illustrated in Figure 6-5. Here, Bank A
owes $1 billion to Bank B, which owes $1 billion to Bank C, with this same
debt going through the alphabet to Bank E. When Bank A goes out of business owing money to Bank B, then Bank B cannot pay Bank C. To the extent
that Bank C lacks the information or the ability to insure against the failure
of Bank A, that failure imposes an externality. One failure could lead to
defaults all the way to Bank E. Such contagion seems particularly wasteful,
because most of it could be averted by getting rid of all the steps in the
middle: the only banks here with net exposure are Banks A and E; once the
middle is eliminated, all that is left is a $1 billion debt of A to E.
Derivatives are an important modern vehicle for counterparty chains.
A derivative is any security whose value is based completely on the value of
one or more reference assets, rates, or indexes. For example, a simple derivative could be constructed as the promise by Party B to pay $1 to Party A if and
only if the stock price of Company XYZ is above $200 a share on December
31, 2012. This contract is a derivative because its payoff is completely
“derived” from the value of XYZ stock; the contract has no meaning that is
independent of XYZ stock. Things begin to grow more complicated when
Party A and Party B begin to make offsetting trades with other parties,
creating counterparty exposures among the group of market participants.
For example, Party B, having taken on the risk that XYZ will climb above
$200 a share, may at some point decide to offset this risk by purchasing a
similar option from Party C. Eventually, Party C makes the reverse trade
with Party D, and soon the chain can extend across the alphabet.

Coordination Contagion
Coordination contagion is illustrated in Figure 6-6. Here, Bank A owns
many assets of Type I and Type II; Bank B owns many assets of Type II and
Type III; and Bank C owns many assets of Type III and Type IV. Suppose
that a negative shock to the value of Type I assets threatens the solvency of
Bank A. In an effort to remain in business, Bank A begins to liquidate its
portfolio by selling Type I and Type II assets. As is typical for banks, these
underlying assets are relatively illiquid, so it is difficult for Bank A to sell
substantial quantities without depressing the price of the assets. As the prices
of Type II assets fall, Bank B is in a quandary. The market value of its assets
is falling, and the regulators of Bank B may insist that it reduce its leverage
or raise more capital. Bank B may then sell Type II and Type III assets to
achieve this goal. Again, it is easy to see how this process could flow through
the alphabet. Here the process is called coordination contagion because it is
driven by the coordinated holdings of the banks, rather than by confidence
of investors (in any particular bank) or the chains of contractual relationships
(among banks) that lead to counterparty contagion. The externality occurs
here only because the underlying assets are illiquid. With this illiquidity, the
transactions of each player can significantly affect the price, and the forced
sale by one bank harms all the others that own these assets.
Coordination contagion is exacerbated if failing institutions are forced
to liquidate their positions quickly. In the fall of 2008, many large financial institutions had significant holdings of subprime housing and other

structured instruments on their balance sheets. With capital scarce and
uncertainty about the value of these assets high, distressed institutions faced
pressure to sell these assets. If the most desperate institutions sold first,
then the depressed prices of these sales would then place pressure on other
institutions to mark down the values of these assets on their balance sheets,
further exacerbating the problem. One partial solution to this coordination
contagion would be to allow the most distressed institutions to exit their
positions slowly, so as not to further destabilize the illiquid market for these
assets. Such slow exits can be enabled by taking failing institutions into a
form of receivership or conservatorship, an enhanced “resolution authority”
for nonbank financial institutions that would be analogous to the FDIC
process for failing depository institutions.

Preventing Future Crises:
Regulatory Reform
The Financial Stability Plan and other policies to address the current
crisis described in Chapter 2 have had a positive short-run effect on the
financial system. To prevent future crises and achieve long-term stability,
however, it will be necessary to fill the gaps in the current regulatory system.
The Administration is working closely with Congress to build a regulatory

174  |  Chapter 6

system for the 21st century.1 The plan for regulatory reform has five key
parts, each covering a different aspect of the financial intermediation system
illustrated by Figure 6-1. The parts of the plan are discussed below, with
references back to the relevant sections of Figure 6-1.

Promote Robust Supervision and Regulation of Financial Firms
If the recent financial crisis has proven anything, it is that we have
outgrown our Depression-era financial regulatory system. Although most
of the largest, most interconnected, and most highly leveraged financial
firms were subject to some form of supervision and regulation before the
crisis, those forms of oversight proved inadequate and inconsistent. The
financial institutions at the top of Figure 6-1 are a varied group that is no
longer dominated by traditional commercial banks. A modern regulatory
system must account for the entire group.
Three primary weaknesses inherent in the current system led to the
crisis. First, capital and liquidity requirements for institutions were simply
not high enough. Regulation failed because firms were not required to hold
sufficient capital to cover trading assets, high-risk loans, and off-balance-sheet
commitments, or to hold increased capital during good times in preparation
for bad times. Nor were firms required to plan for liquidity shortages.
Second, various agencies shared responsibility for supervising the
consolidated operations of large financial firms. This fragmentation of
supervisory responsibility, in addition to loopholes in the legal definition of
a “bank,” made it possible for owners of banks and other insured depository
institutions to shop for the most lenient regulator.
Finally, other types of financial institutions were subject to insufficient
government oversight. Money-market funds were vulnerable to runs, but
unlike their banking cousins, they lacked both regulators and insurers.
Major investment banks were subject to a regulatory regime through the
SEC that is now moot, since large independent investment banks no longer
exist. Meanwhile, hedge funds and other private pools of capital operated
completely outside the existing supervisory framework.
In combination, these three sets of weaknesses increased the likelihood
that some firms would fail and made it less likely that problems at these firms
would be detected early. This was a breakdown in the supervision under
current authority over individual institutions. But glaring problems were
also created by a lack of focus on large, interconnected, and highly leveraged
institutions that could inflict harm both on the financial system and on the

(Department of the Treasury 2009).

economy if they failed. No regulators were tasked with responsibility for
contagion, whether from confidence, counterparties, or coordination.
To solve these problems and ensure the long-term health of the
financial system, the government must create a new foundation for the
regulation of financial institutions. To do that, the Administration will
promote more robust and consistent regulatory standards for all financial
institutions. Not only should similar financial institutions face the same
supervisory and regulatory standards, but the system can contain no gaps,
loopholes, or opportunities for arbitrage.
The Administration has also proposed creating a Financial Services
Oversight Council (FSOC). This body, chaired by the Secretary of the
Treasury, would facilitate coordination of policy and resolution of disputes
and identify emerging risks and gaps in supervision in firms and market
activities. The heads of the principal Federal financial regulators would be
members of the Council, which would benefit from a permanent staff at the
Department of the Treasury.
Finally, the Federal Reserve’s current supervisory authority for bank
holding companies must evolve along with the financial system. Regardless
of whether they own an insured depository institution, all large, interconnected firms whose failure may threaten the stability of the entire system
should be subject to consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve. To
that end, the Administration proposes creating a single point of accountability for the consolidated supervision of all companies that own a bank.
These firms should not be allowed or able to escape oversight of their risky
activities by manipulating their legal structures.
Taken together, these proposals will help reduce the weaknesses in
the financial regulatory system by more stringently regulating the largest,
most interconnected, and most highly leveraged institutions. In effect,
the Administration’s proposals would operate on the simple principle that
firms that could pose higher risks should be subject to higher standards.
Furthermore, both the Federal Reserve and the FSOC would operate
through a macroprudential prism and be wary of contagion in all its forms.

Establish Comprehensive Regulation of Financial Markets
The financial crisis followed a long and remarkable period of growth
and innovation in the Nation’s financial markets. These new financial
markets, found in the bottom part of Figure 6-1, still rely on regulation
put together in response to the Great Depression, when stocks and bonds
were the main financial products for which there were significant markets.
But over time, new financial instruments allowed credit risks to be spread
widely, enabling investors to diversify their portfolios in new ways and
176  |  Chapter 6

allowing banks to shed exposures that once would have had to remain on
their balance sheets. As discussed earlier, securitization allowed mortgages
and other loans to be aggregated with similar loans, segmented, and sold in
tranches to a large and diverse pool of new investors with varied risk preferences. Credit derivatives created a way for banks to transfer much of their
credit exposure to third parties without the outright selling of the underlying
assets. At the time, this innovation in the distribution of risk was perceived
to increase financial stability, promote efficiency, and contribute to a better
allocation of resources.
Far from transparently distributing risk, however, the innovations
often resulted in opaque and complex risk concentrations. Furthermore, the
innovations arose too rapidly for the market’s infrastructure, which consists
of payment, clearing, and settlement systems, to accommodate them, and
for the Nation’s financial supervisors to keep up with them. Furthermore,
many individual financial institutions’ risk management systems failed to
keep up. The result was a disastrous buildup of risk in the over-the-counter
(OTC) derivatives markets. In the run-up to the crisis, many believed these
markets would distribute risk to those most able to bear it. Instead, these
markets became a major source of counterparty contagion during the crisis.
In response to these problems, the Administration proposes creating
a more coherent and coordinated regulatory framework for the markets
for OTC derivatives and asset-backed securities. The Administration’s
proposal, which aims to improve both transparency and market discipline,
would impose record-keeping and reporting requirements on all OTC derivatives. The Administration further proposes strengthening the prudential
regulation of all dealers in the OTC derivative markets and requiring all
standardized OTC derivative transactions to be executed in regulated and
transparent venues and cleared through regulated central counterparties.
The primary goal of these regulatory changes is to reduce the possibility of
the sort of counterparty contagion seen in the recent crisis. Moving activity
to a centralized clearinghouse can effectively break the chain of failures by
netting out middleman parties. A successful clearinghouse can reduce the
counterparty contagion illustrated in Figure 6-5 to a single debt owned by
Bank A to Bank E, thus sparing Banks B, C, and D from the problems.
The Administration has also proposed enhancing the Federal Reserve’s
authority over market infrastructure to reduce the potential for contagion
among financial firms and markets. After all, even a clearinghouse can fail,
and regulators must be alert to this danger. Finally, the Administration
proposes harmonizing the statutory and regulatory regimes between the
futures and securities markets. Although important distinctions exist
between the two, many differences in regulation between them are no longer
Building a Safer Financial System  |  177

justifiable. In particular, the growth and innovation in derivatives and
derivatives markets have highlighted the need to address gaps and inconsistencies in the regulation of these products by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC. In October 2009, the SEC and
the CFTC issued a joint report identifying major areas necessary to reconcile
their regulatory approaches and outlining a series of regulatory and statutory
recommendations to narrow or where possible eliminate those differences.

Provide the Government with the Tools It Needs to Manage
Financial Crises
During the recent crisis, the financial system was strained by the
failure or near-failure of some of the largest and most interconnected financial firms. Thanks to lessons learned from past crises, the current system
already has strong procedures for handling bank failure. However, when a
bank holding company or other nonbank financial firm is in severe distress,
it has only two options: obtain outside capital or file for bankruptcy. In a
normal economic climate, these options would be suitable and would pose
no consequences for broader financial stability. However, during a crisis,
distressed institutions may be hard-pressed to raise sufficient private capital.
Thus, if a large, interconnected bank holding company or other nonbank
financial firm nears failure during a financial crisis, its only two options are
untenable: to obtain emergency funding from the U.S. Government, as in
the case of AIG; or to file for bankruptcy, as in the case of Lehman Brothers.
Neither option manages the resolution of the firm in a manner that limits
damage to the broader economy at minimal cost to the taxpayer.
This situation is unacceptable. A way must be found to address the
potential failure of a bank holding company or other nonbank financial firm
when the stability of the financial system is at risk. To solve this issue, the
Administration proposes creating a new authority modeled on the existing
authority of the FDIC. The Administration has also proposed that the
Federal Reserve Board receive prior written approval from the Secretary
of the Treasury for emergency lending under its “unusual and exigent
circumstances” authority to improve accountability in the use of other crisis
tools. The goal of these proposals is to allow for an orderly resolution of
all large institutions—not just banks—so that the coordination contagion
depicted in Figure 6-6 does not again threaten the entire financial system.
Taking nonbank financial institutions into receivership or conservatorship
would make it possible to sell assets slowly and with minimal disruption to
the values of similar assets at otherwise healthy institutions.

178  |  Chapter 6

Raise International Regulatory Standards and Improve
International Cooperation
The system in Figure 6-1 cannot be managed by one country alone,
because its interconnections are global. As the recent crisis has illustrated,
financial stress can spread quickly and easily across borders. Yet regulation
is still set largely in a national context and has failed to effectively adapt.
Without consistent supervision and regulation, rational financial institutions
will see opportunity in this situation and move their activities to jurisdictions
with looser standards. This can create a “race to the bottom” situation.
The United States is addressing this issue by playing a strong leadership role in efforts to coordinate international financial policy through the
Group of Twenty (G-20), the G-20’s newly established Financial Stability
Board, and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The goal is to
promote international initiatives compatible with the domestic regulatory
reforms described in this report. These efforts have already borne fruit. In
September, the G-20 met in Pittsburgh and agreed in principle to this goal.
And while those processes are ongoing, significant progress has been made
in agreements strengthening prudential requirements, including capital and
liquidity standards; expanding the scope of regulation to nonbank financial institutions, hedge funds, and over-the-counter derivatives markets;
and reinforcing international cooperation on the supervision of globally
active firms.

Protect Consumers and Investors from Financial Abuse
Before the financial crisis, numerous Federal and state regulations
protected consumers against fraud and promoted understanding of financial products like credit cards and mortgages. But as abusive practices
spread, particularly in the subprime and nontraditional mortgage markets,
the Nation’s outdated regulatory framework proved inadequate in crucial
ways. Although multiple agencies now have authority over consumer
protection in financial products, the supervisory framework for enforcing
those regulations has significant shortcomings rooted in history. State and
Federal banking regulators have a primary mission to promote safe and
sound banking practices—placing consumer protection in a subordinate
position—while other agencies have a clear mission but limited tools and
jurisdiction. In the run-up to the financial crisis, mortgage companies and
other firms outside of the purview of bank regulation exploited the lack of
clear accountability by selling subprime mortgages that were overly complicated and unsuited to borrowers’ particular financial situations. Banks and

Building a Safer Financial System  |  179

thrifts eventually followed suit, with disastrous results for consumers and the
financial system at large.
In 2009, Congress, the Administration, and numerous financial
regulators took significant measures to address some of the most obvious
inadequacies in the consumer protection framework. One notable achievement was the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure
Act, signed into law by the President on May 22, 2009. This Act outlaws
some of the most unfair and deceptive practices in the credit card industry.
For example, it requires that payments be applied to the balances with the
highest interest rate first; bans retroactive increases in interest rates for
reasons having nothing to do with the cardholder’s record with the credit
card; prohibits a variety of gimmicks with due dates and “double-cycle fees”;
and requires clearer disclosure and ensures consumer choice.
However, given the weaknesses that the recent financial crisis highlighted, it is clear that the consumer protection system needs comprehensive
reform across all markets. For that reason the Administration has proposed
creating a single regulatory agency, a Consumer Financial Protection Agency
(CFPA), with the authority and accountability to make sure that consumer
protection regulations are written fairly and enforced vigorously. The CFPA
should reduce gaps in Federal supervision and enforcement, improve coordination with the states, set higher standards for financial intermediaries,
and promote consistent regulation of similar products.

Conclusion
Our Nation’s system of financial intermediation is a powerful engine
for economic growth. Productive investment projects are risky, complex to
evaluate and monitor, and require long periods of waiting with no returns
and illiquid capital. Investors who provide the funds for these projects
would be far less willing to do so if they had to absorb all these risks and
costs. Bridging the gap between savings and investment requires the efforts
of millions of talented professionals collectively performing the services of
information production, liquidity transformation, and diversification. In
the recent financial crisis this complex system broke down.
To prevent another such crisis from paralyzing our economy, the
Administration has embarked on an ambitious plan to modernize the
framework of financial regulation. The keystone of the new framework is
an emphasis on macroprudential regulation. The regulatory system’s past
focus on individual institutions served the Nation well for many decades
but is now outdated. A modern system that can meet the needs of the 21st
century must have the tools to monitor and regulate the interconnections
that cause financial crises.

REFORMING Health Care

I

n recent years, rising health care costs in the United States have imposed
tremendous economic burdens on families, employers, and governments
at every level. The number of people without health insurance has also risen
steadily, with recent estimates from the Census Bureau indicating that more
than 46 million were uninsured in 2008.
With the severe recession exacerbating these problems, Congress
and the President worked together during the past year to enact several
health care policies to cushion the impact of the economic downturn on
individuals and families. For example, just two weeks after taking office, the
President signed into law an expansion of the Children’s Health Insurance
Program (CHIP), which will extend health insurance to nearly 4 million
low- and middle-income uninsured children by 2013. Additionally, legislation that increased funding for COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act) health insurance coverage allowed many working
Americans who lost their jobs to receive subsidized health insurance for
themselves and their families, helping to reduce the number of uninsured
below what it otherwise would have been.
In late 2009, both the House and the Senate passed major health
reform bills, bringing the United States closer to comprehensive health
insurance reform than ever before. The legislation would expand insurance coverage to more than 30 million Americans, improve the quality of
care and the security of insurance coverage for individuals with insurance,
and reduce the growth rate of costs in both the private and public sectors.
These reforms would improve the health and economic well-being of tens
of millions of Americans, allow employers to pay higher wages to their
employees and to hire more workers, and reduce the burden of rising health
care costs on Federal, state, and local governments.

181

The Current State of the
U.S. Health Care Sector
Although health outcomes in the United States have improved steadily
in recent decades, the U.S. health care sector is beset by rising spending,
declining rates of health insurance coverage, and inefficiencies in the
delivery of care. In the United States, as in most other developed countries,
advances in medical care have contributed to increases in life expectancy
and reductions in infant mortality. Yet the unrelenting rise in health care
costs in both the private and public sectors has placed a steadily increasing
burden on American families, businesses, and governments at all levels.

Rising Health Spending in the United States
For the past several decades, health care spending in the United States
has consistently risen more rapidly than gross domestic product (GDP).
Recent projections suggest that total spending in the U.S. health care sector
exceeded $2.5 trillion in 2009, representing 17.6 percent of GDP (Sisko et
al. 2009)—approximately twice its share in 1980 and a substantially greater
portion of GDP than that of any other member of the Organisation for
Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD). As shown in Figure
7-1, estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in June 2009
projected that this trend would continue in the absence of significant
health insurance reform. More specifically, CBO estimated that health care
spending would account for one-fourth of GDP by 2025 and one-third by
2040 (Congressional Budget Office 2009d).
The steady growth in health care spending has placed an increasingly
heavy financial burden on individuals and families, with a steadily growing
share of workers’ total compensation going to health care costs. According
to the most recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau, inflation-adjusted
median household income in the United States declined 4.3 percent from
1999 to 2008 (from $52,587 to $50,303), and real weekly median earnings for
full-time workers increased just 1.8 percent. During that same period, the
real average total cost of employer-sponsored health insurance for a family
policy rose by more than 69 percent (Kaiser Family Foundation and Health
Research and Educational Trust 2009).
Because firms choose to compensate workers with either wages or
benefits such as employer-sponsored health insurance, increasing health
care costs tend to “crowd out” increases in wages. Therefore, these rapid

increases in employer-sponsored health insurance premiums have resulted
in much lower wage growth for workers.
When considering these divergent trends, it is also important to
remember that workers typically pay a significant share of their health insurance premiums out of earnings. According to data from the Kaiser Family
Foundation, the average employee share for an employer-sponsored family
policy was 27 percent in both 1999 and 2008. In real dollars, the average total
family premium increased by $5,200 during this nine-year period. Thus, the
amount paid by the typical worker with employer-sponsored health insurance increased by more than $1,400 from 1999 to 2008. Subtracting these
average employee contributions from median household income in each
year gives a rough measure of “post-premium” median household income.
By that measure, the decline in household income swells from 4.3 percent
to 7.3 percent (that is, post-premium income fell from $50,566 to $46,879).
This point is further reinforced when one considers the implications
of rapidly rising health care costs for the wage growth of workers in the
years ahead. As Figure 7-2 shows, compensation net of health insurance
premiums is projected to grow much less rapidly than total compensation,

Reforming Health Care  |  183

with the growth eventually turning negative by 2037.1 Put simply, if health
care costs continue to increase at the rate that they have in recent years,
workers’ take-home wages are likely to grow slowly and eventually decline.

Rising health care spending has placed similar burdens on the
45 million aged and disabled beneficiaries of the Medicare program,
whose inflation-adjusted premiums for Medicare Part B coverage­ which
—
covers outpatient costs including physician fees—rose 64 percent (from
$1,411 to $2,314 per couple per year) between 1999 and 2008. During that
same period, average inflation-adjusted Social Security benefits for retired
workers grew less than 10 percent. Rising health insurance premiums are
thus consuming larger shares of workers’ total compensation and Medicare
recipients’ Social Security benefits alike.

from 2009 through 2020 and at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the subsequent years. The lower
curve plots historical real annual compensation per person net of average total premiums for
employer-sponsored health insurance during the same period. The assumed growth rate of
employer-sponsored premiums is 5 percent, which is slightly lower than the average annual rate
as reported by the Kaiser Family Foundation during the 1999 to 2009 period.

184  |  Chapter 7

The corrosive effects of rising health insurance premiums have not
been limited to businesses and individuals. Increases in outlays for programs
such as Medicare and Medicaid and rising expenditures for uncompensated
care caused by increasing numbers of uninsured Americans have also
strained the budgets of Federal, state, and local governments. The fraction
of Federal spending devoted to health care rose from 11.1 percent in 1980
to 25.2 percent in 2008. In the absence of reform, this trend is projected to
continue, resulting in lower spending on other programs, higher taxes, or
increases in the Federal deficit.
The upward trend in health care spending has also posed problems for
state governments, with spending on the means-tested Medicaid program
now the second largest category of outlays in their budgets, just behind
elementary and secondary education. Because virtually all state governments must balance their budgets each year, the rapid increases in Medicaid
spending have forced lawmakers to decide whether to cut spending in areas
such as public safety and education or to increase taxes.
If health care costs continue rising, the consequences for
government budgets at the local, state, and Federal level could be dire. And
as discussed in Chapter 5, projected increases in the costs of the Medicare and
Medicaid programs are a key source of the Federal Government’s long-term
fiscal challenges.

Market Failures in the Current U.S. Health Care System:
Theoretical Background
As described by Nobel Laureate Kenneth Arrow in a seminal 1963
paper, an individual’s choice to purchase health insurance is rooted in
the economics of risk and uncertainty. Over their lifetimes, people face
substantial risks from events that are largely beyond their control. When
possible, those who are risk-averse prefer to hedge against these risks by
purchasing insurance (Arrow 1963).
Health care is no exception. When people become sick, they face
potentially debilitating medical bills and often must stop working and forgo
earnings. Moreover, medical expenses are not equally distributed: annual
medical costs for most people are relatively small, but some people face ruinously large costs. Although total health care costs for the median respondent
in the 2007 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey were less than $1,100, costs for
those at the 90th percentile of the distribution were almost 14 times higher
(Department of Health and Human Services 2009). As a result, risk-averse
people prefer to trade an uncertain stream of expenses for medical care for
the certainty of a regular insurance payment, which buys a policy that pays
for the high cost of treatment during illness or injury. Economic theory and
Reforming Health Care  |  185

common sense suggest that purchasing health insurance to hedge the risk
associated with the economic costs of poor health makes people better off.
Health insurance markets, however, do not function perfectly. The
economics literature documents four primary impediments: adverse selection, moral hazard, the Samaritan’s dilemma, and problems arising from
incomplete insurance contracts. In a health insurance market characterized
by these and other sources of inefficiency, well-designed government policy
has the potential to reduce costs, improve efficiency, and benefit patients by
stabilizing risk pools for insurance coverage and providing needed coverage
to those who otherwise could not afford it.
Adverse Selection. In the case of adverse selection, buyers and sellers
have asymmetric information about the characteristics of market participants. People with larger health risks want to buy more generous insurance,
while those with smaller health risks want lower premiums for coverage.
Insurers cannot perfectly determine whether a potential purchaser is a large
or small health risk.
To understand how adverse selection can harm insurance markets,
suppose that a group of individuals is given a choice to buy health insurance
or pay for medical costs out-of-pocket. The insurance rates for the group
will depend on the average cost of health care for those who elect to purchase
insurance. The healthiest members of the group may decide that the insurance is too expensive, given their expected costs. If they choose not to get
insurance, the average cost of care for those who purchase insurance will
increase. As premiums increase, more and more healthy individuals may
choose to leave the insurance market, further increasing average health care
costs for those who purchase insurance. Over time, this winnowing process
can lead to declining insurance rates and even an unraveling of health insurance markets. Without changes to the structure of insurance markets, the
markets can break down, and fewer people can receive insurance than would
be optimal. Subsidies to encourage individuals to purchase health insurance
can help combat adverse selection, as can regulations requiring that individuals purchase insurance, because both ensure that healthier people enter
the risk pool along with their less healthy counterparts.
Under current institutional arrangements, adverse selection is likely
to be an especially large problem for small businesses and for people
purchasing insurance in the individual market. In large firms, where
employees are generally hired for reasons unrelated to their health, highand low-risk employees are automatically pooled together, reducing the
probability of low-risk employees opting out of coverage or high-risk
workers facing extremely high premiums. In contrast, small employers
cannot pool risk across a large group of workers, and thus the average risk
186  |  Chapter 7

of a given small firm’s employee pool can be significantly above or below
the population average. As such, similar to the market for individual insurance described above, firms with low-risk worker pools will tend to opt
out of insurance coverage, leaving firms with high-risk pools to pay much
higher premiums.
Moral Hazard. A second problem with health insurance is moral
hazard: the tendency for some people to use more health care because they
are insulated from its price. When individuals purchase insurance, they no
longer pay the full cost of their medical care. As a result, insurance may
induce some people to consume health care on which they place much
less value than the actual cost of this care or discourage patients and their
doctors from choosing the most efficient treatment. This extra consumption
could increase average medical costs and, ultimately, insurance premiums.
The presence of moral hazard suggests that research into which treatments
deliver the greatest health benefits could encourage doctors and patients to
adopt best practices.
Samaritan’s Dilemma. A third source of inefficiency in the insurance
market is that society’s desire to treat all patients, even those who do not
have insurance and cannot pay for their care, gives rise to the Samaritan’s
dilemma. Because governments and their citizens naturally wish to provide
care for those who need it, people who lack insurance and cannot pay for
medical care can still receive some care when they fall ill. Some people may
even choose not to purchase insurance because they understand that emergency care may still be available to them. In the context of adverse selection,
a low insurance rate is a symptom of underlying inefficiencies. Viewed
through the lens of the Samaritan’s dilemma, in contrast, the millions of
uninsured Americans are one source of health care inefficiencies.
The burden of paying for some of this uncompensated care is passed
on to people who do purchase insurance. The result is a “hidden tax” on
health insurance premiums, which in turn exacerbates adverse selection
by raising premiums for individuals who do not opt out of coverage. One
estimate suggests that the total amount of uncompensated care for the
uninsured was approximately $56 billion in 2008 (Hadley et al. 2008).
Incomplete Insurance Contracts. Many economic transactions
involve a single, straightforward interaction between a buyer and a seller. In
many purchases of goods, for example, the prospective buyer can look the
good over carefully, decide whether or not to purchase it, and never interact
with the seller again. Health insurance, in contrast, involves a complex
relationship between an insurance company and a patient that can last years
or even decades. It is not possible to foresee and spell out in detail every
contingency that may arise and what is and is not covered.
Reforming Health Care  |  187

When individuals are healthy, their medical costs are typically lower
than their premiums, and these patients are profitable for insurance companies. When patients become ill, however, they may no longer be profitable.
Insurance companies therefore have a financial incentive to find ways to
deny care or drop coverage when individuals become sick, undermining
the central purpose of insurance. For example, in most states, insurance
companies can rescind coverage if individuals fail to list any medical conditions—even those they know nothing about—on their initial health status
questionnaire. Entire families can lose vital health insurance coverage
in this manner. A House committee investigation found that three large
insurers rescinded nearly 20,000 policies over a five-year period, saving these
companies $300 million that would otherwise have been paid out as claims
(Waxman and Barton 2009).
A closely related problem is that insurance companies are reluctant
to accept patients who may have high costs in the future. As a result,
individuals with preexisting conditions find obtaining health insurance
extremely expensive, regardless of whether the conditions are costly today.
This is a major problem in the individual market for health insurance.
Forty-four states now permit insurance companies to deny coverage, charge
inflated premiums, or refuse to cover whole categories of illnesses because
of preexisting medical conditions. A recent survey found that 36 percent
of non-elderly adults attempting to purchase insurance in the individual
market in the previous three years faced higher premiums or denial of
coverage because of preexisting conditions (Doty et al. 2009). In another
survey, 1 in 10 people with cancer said they could not obtain health coverage,
and 6 percent said they lost their coverage because of being diagnosed with
the disease (USA Today, Kaiser Family Foundation, and Harvard School of
Public Health 2006). And the problem affects not only people with serious
medical conditions, but also young and healthy people with relatively minor
conditions such as allergies or asthma.

System-Wide Evidence of Inefficient Spending
While an extensive literature in economic theory makes the case for
market failure in the provision of health insurance, a substantial body of
evidence documents the pervasiveness of inefficient allocation of spending
and resources throughout the health care system. Evidence that health care
spending may be inefficient comes from analyses of the relationship between
health care spending and health outcomes, both across states in our own
Nation and across countries around the world.
Within the United States, research suggests that the substantially
higher rates of health care utilization in some geographic areas are not
188  |  Chapter 7

associated with better health outcomes, even after accounting for differences
in medical care prices, patient demographics, and regional rates of illness
(Wennberg, Fisher, and Skinner 2002). Evidence from Medicare reveals
that spending per enrollee varies widely across regions, without being clearly
linked to differences in either medical needs or outcomes. One comparison
of composite quality scores for medical centers and average spending per
Medicare beneficiary found that facilities in states with low average costs
are as likely or even more likely to provide recommended care for some
common health problems than are similar facilities in states with high
costs (Congressional Budget Office 2008). One study suggests that nearly
30 percent of Medicare’s costs could be saved if Medicare per capita spending
in all regions were equal to that in the lowest-cost areas (Wennberg, Fisher,
and Skinner 2002).
Variations in spending tend to be more dramatic in cases where
medical experts are uncertain about the best kind of treatment to administer. For instance, in the absence of medical consensus over the best use
of imaging and diagnostic testing for heart attacks, use rates vary widely
geographically, leading to corresponding variation in health spending.
Research that helps medical providers understand and use the most effective treatment can help reduce this uncertainty, lower costs, and improve
health outcomes.
Overuse of “supply-sensitive services,” such as specialist care,
diagnostic tests, and admissions to intensive care facilities among patients
with chronic illnesses, as well as differences in social norms among local
physicians, seems to drive up per capita spending in high-cost areas
(Congressional Budget Office 2008). Moral hazard may help to explain
some of the overuse of services that do not improve people’s health status.
Health care spending also differs as a share of GDP across countries,
without corresponding systematic differences in outcomes. For example,
according to the United Nations, the estimated U.S. infant mortality rate of
6.3 per 1,000 infants for the 2005 to 2010 period is projected to be substantially higher than that in any other Group of Seven (G-7) country, as is the
mortality rate among children under the age of five, as shown in Figure
7-3 (United Nations 2007). This variation is especially striking when one
considers that the United States has the highest GDP per capita of any
G-7 country. Although drawing direct conclusions from cross-country
comparisons is difficult because of underlying health differences, this
comparison further suggests that the United States could lower health care
spending without sacrificing quality. Similarly, life expectancy is much
lower in the United States than in other advanced economies. The OECD
estimated life expectancy at birth in 2006 to be 78.1 years in the United States
Reforming Health Care  |  189

compared with an average of 80.7 in other G-7 countries (Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development 2009).

Recent research suggests that differences in health care systems
account for at least part of these cross-country differences in life expectancy.
For example, one study (Nolte and McKee 2008) analyzed mortality from
causes that could be prevented by effective health care, which the authors
term “amenable mortality.” They found that the amenable mortality rate
among men in the United States in 1997–98 was 8 percent higher than the
average rate in 18 other industrialized countries. The corresponding rate
among U.S. women was 17 percent higher than the average among these
other 18 countries. Moreover, of all 19 countries considered, the United
States had the smallest decline during the subsequent five years, with a
decline of just 4 percent compared with an average decline of 16 percent
across the remaining 18. The authors further estimated that if the U.S.
improvement had been equal to the average improvement for the other
countries, the number of preventable deaths in the United States would
have been 75,000 lower in 2002. This finding suggests that the U.S. health
care system has been improving much less rapidly than the systems in other
industrialized countries in recent years.

190  |  Chapter 7

A further indication that our health care system is in need of reform
is that satisfaction with care has, if anything, been declining despite the
substantial increases in spending. Not surprisingly, this decline in satisfaction has been concentrated among people without health insurance, whose
ranks have swelled considerably during the past decade. For example, from
2000 to 2009, the fraction of uninsured U.S. residents reporting that they
were satisfied with their health care fell from 36 to 26 percent. And not only
has dissatisfaction with our health care system increased over time, it is also
noticeably greater than dissatisfaction with systems in many other developed
nations (Commonwealth Fund 2008).

Declining Coverage and Strains on Particular Groups and Sectors
The preceding analysis shows that at an aggregate level, there are
major inefficiencies in the current health care system. But, because of the
nature of the market failures in health care, the current system works particularly poorly in certain parts of the economy and places disproportionate
burdens on certain groups. Moreover, because of rising costs, many of the
strains are increasing over time.
Declining Coverage among Non-Elderly Adults. The rapid increase
in health insurance premiums in recent years has caused many firms to stop
offering health insurance to their workers, forcing employees either to pay
higher prices for coverage in the individual market (which is often much
less generous than coverage in the group market) or to go without health
insurance entirely. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, between
2000 and 2009, the share of firms offering health insurance to their workers
fell from 69 to 60 percent. Furthermore, 8 percent of firms offering coverage
in 2009 reported that they were somewhat or very likely to drop coverage
in 2010.
Largely because of these falling offer rates, private health insurance
coverage declined substantially during this same period. As shown in Figure
7-4, the fraction of non-elderly adults in the United States with private health
insurance coverage fell from 75.5 percent in 2000 to 69.5 percent in 2008.
These numbers, however, provide just a snapshot of health insurance
coverage in the United States because they measure the fraction of people
who are uninsured at a point in time and thus obscure the fact that a large
fraction of the population has been uninsured at some point in the past.
According to recent research, at least 48 percent of non-elderly Americans
were uninsured at some point between 1996 and 2006 (Department of the
Treasury 2009).

Although roughly half of the 2000–2008 decline in private coverage
displayed in Figure 7-4 has been offset by an increase in public health
insurance, the share of non-elderly adults without health insurance nevertheless rose from 17.2 to 20.3 percent. In other words, approximately
5.9 million more adults were uninsured in 2008 than would have been had
the fraction uninsured remained constant since 2000. The decline in private
health insurance coverage was similarly large among children, although it
was more than offset by increases in public health insurance (most notably
Medicaid and CHIP), so that less than 10 percent of children were uninsured
by 2008 (DeNavas-Walt, Proctor, and Smith 2009).
The generosity of private health insurance coverage has also been
declining in recent years. For example, from 2006 to 2009, the fraction of
covered workers enrolled in an employer-sponsored plan with a deductible of $1,000 or greater for single coverage more than doubled, from 10 to
22 percent. The increase in deductibles was also striking among covered
workers with family coverage. For example, during this same three-year
period, the fraction of enrollees in preferred provider organizations with
a deductible of $2,000 or more increased from 8 to 17 percent. Similar
increases in cost-sharing were apparent for visits with primary care physicians. The fraction of covered workers with a copayment of $25 or more
for an office visit with a primary care physician increased from 12 to
31 percent from 2004 to 2009. These rising costs in the private market
192  |  Chapter 7

fall disproportionately on the near-elderly, who have higher medical costs
but are not eligible for Medicare. A recent study found that the average
family premium in the individual market in 2009 for those aged 60–64 was
93 percent higher than the average family premium for individuals aged
35–39 (America’s Health Insurance Plans 2009).
Low Insurance Coverage among Young Adults and Low-Income
Individuals. Figure 7-5 shows the relationship between age and the fraction of people without health insurance in 2008. One striking pattern is the
sharp and substantial rise in this fraction as individuals enter adulthood. For
example, the share of 20-year-olds without health insurance is more than
twice that of 17-year-olds (28 percent compared with 12 percent).

Adverse selection is clearly a key source of this change. Many
teenagers obtain insurance through their parents’ employer-provided family
policies, and so are in large pools. Many young adults, in contrast, do not
have this coverage and are either jobless or work at jobs that do not offer
health insurance; thus, they must either buy insurance on the individual
market or go uninsured. As described above, health insurance coverage in
the individual market can be very expensive because of adverse selection.
Many young adults also have very low incomes, making the cost of coverage
Reforming Health Care  |  193

prohibitively high for them. Furthermore, because they are, on average, in
very good health, young adults may be more tolerant than other groups of
the risks associated with being uninsured.
The burden of rising costs also falls differentially on low-income
individuals, who find it more difficult each year to afford coverage through
employer plans or the individual market. Indeed, as shown in Figure 7-6,
low-income individuals are substantially more likely to be uninsured than
their higher-income counterparts. As the figure shows, non-elderly individuals below the Federal poverty line ($10,830 a year in income for an
individual and $22,050 for a family of four in 2009) were five times as likely
to be uninsured as their counterparts above 400 percent of the poverty
line in 2008. These low rates of insurance coverage increase insurance
premiums for other Americans because of the “hidden tax” that arises from
the financing of uncompensated care.

The Elderly. Even those over the age of 65 are not protected from
high costs, despite almost universal coverage through Medicare. Consider
prescription drug expenses, for which the majority of Medicare recipients
have coverage through Medicare Part D. As shown in Figure 7-7, after the
initial deductible of $310, a standard Part D plan in 2010 covers 75 percent
194  |  Chapter 7

of the cost of drugs only up to $2,830 in annual prescription drug spending.
After that, enrollees are responsible for all expenditures on prescriptions
up to $6,440 in total drug spending (where out-of-pocket costs would be
$4,550), at which point they qualify for catastrophic coverage with a modest
copayment. Millions of beneficiaries fall into this coverage gap—termed the
“donut hole”—every year, and as a result many may not be able to afford to
fill needed prescriptions.

In 2007, one-quarter of Part D enrollees who filled one or more
prescriptions but did not receive low-income subsidies had prescription
drug expenses that were high enough to reach the coverage gap. For that
reason, 3.8 million Medicare recipients reached the initial coverage limit and
were required to pay the full cost of additional pharmaceutical treatments
received while in the coverage gap, despite having insurance for prescription
drug costs. One study found that in 2007, 15 percent of Part D enrollees in
the coverage gap using pharmaceuticals in one or more of eight major drug
classes stopped taking their medication (Hoadley et al. 2008).

Reforming Health Care  |  195

Small Businesses. As described earlier, adverse selection is a serious
problem for small businesses, which do not have large numbers of workers
to pool risks. This problem manifests itself in two forms. The first is high
costs. Because of high broker fees and administrative costs as well as adverse
selection, small firms pay up to 18 percent more per worker for the same
policy than do large firms (Gabel et al. 2006). The second is low coverage.
Employees at small businesses are almost three times as likely as their
counterparts at large firms to be uninsured (29 percent versus 11 percent,
according to the March 2009 Current Population Survey). And among small
businesses that do offer insurance, only 22 percent of covered workers are
offered a choice of more than one type of plan (Kaiser Family Foundation
and Health Research and Educational Trust 2009).
In recent years, small businesses and their employees have had an
especially difficult time managing the rapidly rising cost of health care.
Consistent with this, the share of firms with three to nine employees offering
health insurance to their workers fell from 57 to 46 percent between 2000
and 2009.
As discussed in a Council of Economic Advisers report issued in
July 2009, high insurance costs in the small-group market discourage entrepreneurs from launching their own companies, and the low availability of
insurance discourages many people from working at small firms (Council
of Economic Advisers 2009c). As a result, the current system discourages
entrepreneurship and hurts the competitiveness of existing small businesses.
Given the key role of small businesses in job creation and growth, this harms
the entire economy.
Taken together, the trends summarized in this section demonstrate that in recent years the rapid rise in health insurance premiums has
reduced the take-home pay of American workers and eaten into increases
in Medicare recipients’ Social Security benefits. Fewer firms are electing to
offer health insurance to their workers, and those that do are reducing the
generosity of that coverage through increased cost-sharing. Fewer individuals each year can afford to purchase health insurance coverage. The current
system places small businesses at a competitive disadvantage. And finally,
the steady increases in health care spending strain the budgets of families,
businesses, and governments at every level, and demonstrate the need for
health insurance reform that slows the growth rate of costs.

Health Policies Enacted in 2009
Since taking office, the President has signed into law a series of
provisions aimed at expanding health insurance coverage, improving the
quality of care, and reducing the growth rate of health care spending. The
196  |  Chapter 7

American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided vital support to
those hit hardest by the economic downturn while helping to ensure access
to doctors, nurses, and hospitals for Americans who lost jobs and income.
At the same time, legislation extended health insurance coverage to millions
of children, and improvements in health system quality and efficiency benefited the entire health care system. These necessary first steps have set the
stage for a more fundamental reform of the U.S. health care system, one that
will ensure access to affordable, high-quality coverage and that genuinely
slows the growth rate of health care spending.

Expansion of the CHIP Program
Just two weeks after taking office, the President signed into law the
Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act, which provides
funding that expands access to nearly 4 million additional children by
2013. This guarantee of coverage also kept millions of children from losing
insurance in the midst of the recession, when many workers lost employersponsored coverage for themselves and their dependents. An examination of
data from recent surveys by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
found that private coverage among children fell by 2.5 percentage points
from the first six months of 2008 to the first six months of 2009. Despite the
fall in private coverage, however, fewer children were uninsured during that
six-month period in 2009, in large part because public coverage increased by
3 percentage points (Martinez and Cohen 2008, 2009).
Approximately 7 million children (1 in every 10) were uninsured in
2008 (DeNavas-Walt, Proctor, and Smith 2009). Once fully phased in, the
CHIP reauthorization legislation signed by the President will lower that
number by as much as half from the 2008 baseline. In the future, this new
legislation will enhance the quality of medical care for children and improve
their health. Research has convincingly shown that expanding health
insurance to children is very cost-effective, because it not only increases
access to care but also substantially lowers mortality (Currie and Gruber
1996a, 1996b).

Subsidized COBRA Coverage
In part because of the difficulty of purchasing health insurance on the
individual market (owing to adverse selection), most Americans get health
insurance through their own or a family member’s job. And what is true
for dependent children is true for their parents: when economic conditions deteriorate, the number of people with employer-sponsored health
insurance tends to fall. However, unlike the case with children, during
the current recession public coverage has only offset part of the reduction
Reforming Health Care  |  197

in private health insurance coverage among adults. Thus, the fraction
of adults without health insurance has increased. Figure 7-8 uses survey
data from Gallup to show that from the third quarter of 2008 to the first
quarter of 2009, the share of U.S. adults without health insurance rose by
1.7 percentage points, from 14.4 to 16.1 percent, representing an estimated
increase of 4.0 million uninsured individuals.

When workers at large firms lose their jobs, COBRA provisions give
them the right to continue existing coverage for themselves and their families. However, they are often required to pay the full premium cost with
no assistance from former employers and without favorable tax treatment
of their insurance benefits. Thus, although a large fraction of workers who
lose their jobs can still purchase health insurance through COBRA at group
rates, many elect not to do so, likely because the coverage is not affordable
to a family with a newly laid-off wage earner.
One provision of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
addressed the recession-induced drop in employer-sponsored health insurance by subsidizing COBRA coverage so that individuals pay only 35 percent
of their premium, with the Federal Government covering the remaining
65 percent. This large subsidy may partially explain why the growth in the
share of American adults without health insurance slowed dramatically from
198  |  Chapter 7

the first to the fourth quarter of 2009, even while the unemployment rate
continued to rise. While the average rate of uninsurance in 2009 was still
1.4 percentage points higher than the average in 2008, the rate was fairly
constant throughout 2009. Thus, while the CHIP expansion was providing
stable coverage to millions of children who would otherwise have lost it,
the COBRA subsidy was further reinforcing access to coverage for working
parents and families who faced unemployment.

Temporary Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP)
Increase
Historically, declines in employer-sponsored health insurance have
led to increases in the number of people who qualify for public health insurance through programs such as Medicaid, which insured 45.8 million U.S.
residents in December 2007. Because almost half of all Medicaid spending
is typically financed by state governments, state Medicaid spending tends to
rise substantially when economic conditions deteriorate. Coupled with the
recession-induced drop in state tax revenues, these increases in Medicaid
enrollment place a considerable strain on state budgets. And because
virtually every state is required to balance its budget each year, increases in
Medicaid enrollment often leave states with little choice but to raise taxes,
lay off employees, reduce spending on public safety, education, and other
important priorities, or reduce Medicaid benefits, provider payments, or
eligibility. These policies are especially problematic when the economy is in
severe recession, because they can stifle economic recovery.
Figure 7-9 uses administrative data from all 50 states and the
District of Columbia to contrast the growth in Medicaid enrollment in
the months leading up to the start of the recession in December 2007
with the corresponding growth during the recession.2 An examination of the data displayed in the figure reveals that, after growing from
45.2 million in September 2006 to 45.8 million in December 2007, the number
of Medicaid recipients increased much more rapidly in the subsequent
21 months, and stood at 51.1 million in September 2009. This represents
an increase of 253,000 Medicaid recipients per month during the recession, versus an average increase of just 36,000 per month in the preceding
15 months.

Data on state Medicaid enrollment were derived from direct communication between the
Council of Economic Advisers and state health departments in 50 states and the District of
Columbia. Monthly enrollment from September 2006 through September 2009 was reported
by all states with the exception of Vermont in the first 10 months considered. For each month
from September 2006 through June 2007 in Vermont, the state’s July 2007 Medicaid enrollment
was used.

To help states pay for an expanding Medicaid program without
raising taxes or cutting key services, one important component of the
Recovery Act was a temporary increase in each state’s Federal Medical
Assistance Percentage (FMAP), the share of Medicaid spending paid by the
Federal Government. This fiscal relief allowed states to avoid cutbacks to
their Medicaid programs or other adjustments that would have exacerbated
the effects of the recession. The increased FMAPs were larger for states
where unemployment increased the most, because their financial strains
were greatest. To qualify for the increased FMAPs, states were required to
maintain Medicaid eligibility at pre-recession levels.
A recent report by the Kaiser Family Foundation confirms that
support from the Recovery Act—as well as the expansion of coverage for
children enacted several weeks earlier in February 2009—was essential to
preserving the ability of states to offer health insurance coverage to those
most in need. In fact, more than half the states expanded access to health
insurance coverage for low-income children, parents, and pregnant women
in Medicaid and CHIP in 2009 (Ross and Jarlenski 2009).

Recovery Act Measures to Improve the Quality and Efficiency of
Health Care
Beyond supporting jobless workers and their families in the midst
of the recession, the Recovery Act addressed structural weaknesses in the
health care system by investing in its infrastructure and its workforce. These
investments will help to build a health care system with lower costs and
better health outcomes for the long term.
For example, the Recovery Act invested $2 billion in health centers
for new construction, renovation of existing facilities, and expansion of
coverage. An additional $500 million was allocated to bolster the primary
care workforce to improve access to primary care in underserved areas.
The Act provided a further $1 billion in funding for public health activities to improve prevention and to incentivize wellness initiatives for those
with chronic illness; both measures are aimed at improving the quality of
care and ultimately bringing down costs. The Act also increased spending
on comparative effectiveness research by $1.1 billion, to give doctors and
patients access to the most credible and up-to-date information about which
treatments are likely to work best.
One final component of the Recovery Act was the Health Information
Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which expanded the
adoption and use of health information technology through infrastructure
formation, information security improvements, and incentives for adoption and meaningful use of certified health information technology. This
investment in developing computerized medical records will reduce health
care spending and improve quality while securing patients’ confidential
information.
These investments build a foundation for comprehensive health
insurance reform by adding to the ranks of doctors, nurses, and other health
care providers, especially in critical fields like primary care, and in areas of
the country with the greatest need for a more robust medical workforce.
Moreover, the investments in comparative effectiveness research and health
information technology will make it much easier for information and quality
improvements to spread rapidly between doctors, medical practices, and
hospitals across the public and private sectors. When combined with the
wide range of delivery system changes included in health insurance reform
legislation, these investments are expected to contain costs and improve
quality over the long run.
In summary, legislation passed in 2009 helped extend or continue
health insurance coverage for the workers, families, and children affected
by the current recession. Rather than focusing solely on today’s crisis, the

Reforming Health Care  |  201

legislation lays the groundwork for a reformed health care system that
addresses the weaknesses, flaws, and inefficiencies of the status quo.

2009 Health Reform Legislation
As this Report goes to press, Congress has come closer to passing
comprehensive health insurance reform than ever before, with major bills
having passed both the House and the Senate. As of this writing, whether
those bills will lead to enactment of final legislation in the near future is
uncertain. Nonetheless, the bills contain important features that would
expand coverage, slow the growth rate of costs while improving the quality
of care, and benefit individuals, businesses, and governments at every level.
This section discusses the major features of the two bills—the House’s
Affordable Health Care for America Act and the Senate’s Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act.

Insurance Market Reforms: Strengthening and Securing
Coverage
Both the House and the Senate bills contain important features that
would immediately expand coverage and increase access to preventive care.
The legislation would also strengthen regulation of the health insurance
market, improve consumer protections, and secure coverage for more than
30 million Americans. These regulations would correct insurance market
failures by preventing health insurers from responding to adverse selection
by raising rates and denying coverage, thus stabilizing risk pools to secure
access to affordable coverage.
Both versions of the legislation provide immediate Federal support
for a new program to provide coverage to uninsured Americans with
preexisting conditions. Combined with strong new consumer protections,
these measures would ensure that millions of Americans can immediately
purchase coverage at more affordable prices despite their personal medical
history or health risks. Health insurance reform also makes immediate
investments in community health centers, which would improve access
to coverage among the most vulnerable populations. Both the House and
Senate versions of reform immediately create reinsurance programs for
employer health plans, providing coverage for early retirees to prevent
them from becoming uninsured before they are covered by Medicare.
Additionally, reform legislation would immediately begin to reform delivery
systems for health care and improve transparency and choice for consumers.
For example, the Senate proposal would create a website that would help

202  |  Chapter 7

consumers compare coverage options by summarizing important aspects
of each insurance contract in a consistent and easy-to-understand format.
New laws would help cover millions of young adults as they transition
into the workforce by requiring insurers to allow extended family coverage
for dependents through their mid-20s. The CBO and the Joint Committee
on Taxation estimate that this requirement would lower average premiums
per person in the large-group market by increasing the number of relatively
healthy low-cost people in large-group pools (Congressional Budget Office
2009a).
In the years following reform, legislation would put into place strong
new consumer protections to prevent denials of coverage or excessive costs
for the less healthy. Insurers would be required to renew any policy for
which the premium has been paid in full. Insurers could not refuse to renew
because someone became sick, nor could they drop or water down insurance
coverage for those who are or become ill. To prevent insurers from charging
excessively high rates to the less healthy, reform legislation would also enact
adjusted community rating rules for premiums.
Banning such treatment of individuals with preexisting conditions
would not only allow insurance markets to better help individuals hedge
against the risk of health care costs, but may also make the U.S. labor market
more efficient. Without such protections, adults with preexisting conditions
may be reluctant to change insurance providers and expose themselves to
increased premiums. Workers who receive health insurance through their
employers may therefore be less willing to change jobs, creating “job lock”
that discourages desirable adjustments in the labor market.
In both versions of reform legislation, these provisions are linked
with incentives for individuals to obtain coverage and for firms to insure
their workers. While preventing insurance companies from discriminating
based on preexisting conditions will help some of the neediest members of
our society, in isolation these reforms could increase costs for individuals
without preexisting conditions, potentially aggravating adverse selection.
Without a responsibility to maintain health insurance coverage, individuals
could forgo purchasing coverage until they fell ill, and thus not contribute
to a shared insurance risk pool until their expected costs rose sharply.
However, with restrictions on exclusions for preexisting conditions in place,
high-cost individuals who sign up after falling ill could obtain coverage at
low premiums. Thus, individuals who had contributed toward coverage
would be faced with higher costs, potentially driving even more individuals
out of coverage. To prevent a spiral of increasing costs and decreasing insurance rates resulting from adverse selection, both the House and the Senate
bills establish a principle of joint individual and employer responsibility to
Reforming Health Care  |  203

obtain and provide insurance, and would provide subsidies and tax credits
that would assist in this process.
The bills would address other features of many health plans that limit
their ability to help individuals insure against financial risk. Currently,
insurers can put yearly and lifetime limits on coverage. For people with
diseases such as cancer, life-saving treatment is often very costly, and
exceeding annual and lifetime benefit limits can lead to bankruptcy. This
problem is especially severe in the individual and small-group markets,
where insurers have more discretion in designing policies. Insurance plans
that allow individuals to bankrupt themselves may be socially inefficient
because of the Samaritan’s dilemma: medical bills that are unpaid when a
patient becomes bankrupt impose a hidden tax on other participants in the
health care market.
In addition to these insurance market reforms, legislation passed by
Congress would require coverage of preventive care and exempt preventive care benefits from deductibles and other cost-sharing requirements in
Medicare and private insurance. Evidence suggests that not only are certain
preventive care measures cost-effective, but they can also help to prevent
diseases that are responsible for roughly half of yearly mortality in the
United States (Mokdad et al. 2004). Some measures, such as smoking cessation programs, discussing aspirin use with high-risk adults, and childhood
immunizations, may even lower total health care spending (Maciosek et al.
2006). Because many people change insurance companies several times over
the course of their lives, insurance companies may underinvest in preventive care that is cost-effective but does not reduce medical costs until far in
the future. By encouraging all insurance companies to invest in preventive
care, health insurance reform would increase the efficiency of the health
care sector.
Finally, reform legislation takes steps to make prescription drug
coverage more affordable and secure for senior citizens. The legislation
would increase the initial coverage limit under Medicare Part D by $500
in 2010 and also provide 50 percent price discounts for brand-name drugs
in the “donut hole” discussed earlier. This discount would allow many
Medicare Part D recipients to reduce their out-of-pocket spending on
prescription drugs. Not only would fewer beneficiaries have to pay the full
cost of their prescription drugs while in the donut hole, but those who do
reach this coverage gap would also benefit from increased coverage before
reaching that point.
In summary, within the first few years after passage, reform legislation
in Congress would guarantee coverage for those with preexisting conditions,
reform private insurance markets with strong consumer protections that
204  |  Chapter 7

would stabilize risk pools and mitigate adverse selection, and strengthen
public coverage under Medicare.

Expansions in Health Insurance Coverage Through the Exchange
Central to both the House and the Senate bills is the health insurance
exchange, which would allow individuals and employees of small businesses
to choose among many different insurance plans. The exchange would
provide a centralized marketplace to allow individuals, families, and small
firms to pool together and purchase coverage much like larger firms do
today, improving consumer choice and increasing pressure on insurers to
offer lower prices and more generous benefits to attract customers. In its
first year of operation, the exchange would be open to qualified individuals
and small businesses.
Individuals and small businesses, which might otherwise purchase
health insurance in the individual or small-group markets, would benefit
from the economies of scale and greater buying leverage in the exchange,
which could result in much lower premiums. The exchange would also
provide transparent information on plan quality, out-of-pocket costs,
covered benefits, and premiums for each offered plan, enabling individuals
to select the plan that best fits their and their family’s needs. The availability
of easy-to-compare premium information would provide a powerful incentive for health insurers to price competitively, thus making coverage more
affordable for participants in the exchange.
The new exchange would be especially beneficial for small business
employees, who, as described earlier, face particularly severe challenges in
the health insurance market. The bills would enable small businesses that
meet certain criteria to purchase insurance through the exchange, allowing
them and their workers to buy better coverage at lower costs. Moreover,
many small businesses that provide health insurance for their employees
would receive a tax credit to alleviate their disproportionately higher costs
and to encourage coverage. The tax credit would lower the cost of coverage
by as much as 50 percent. Reform would make it easier for small businesses
to recruit talented workers and would also increase workers’ incentives
to start their own small businesses. A recent analysis of the Senate bill
by the CBO found that premiums for a given amount of coverage for the
same set of people or small businesses would fall in the individual and
small-group markets as a result of reductions in administrative costs and
increased competition in a centralized marketplace (Congressional Budget
Office 2009a).
Most individuals who select a plan in the exchange would be eligible
for subsidies that reduce the cost of their coverage. In both the House and
Reforming Health Care  |  205

Senate bills, subsidies would be available to certain individuals and families
with incomes below 400 percent of the Federal poverty line. The premium
and out-of-pocket spending subsidies for plans purchased in the exchange
would be larger for lower-income families, many of whom cannot afford the
cost of a private plan. In addition, individuals with incomes below about
133 to 150 percent of the poverty line would be eligible for health insurance
through the Medicaid program.
In the exchange, Federal subsidies would be tied to premiums for
relatively lower-cost “reference” plans. Beneficiaries would, however, be
able to buy more extensive coverage at an additional, unsubsidized cost.

Economic and Health Benefits of Expanding Health Insurance
Coverage
CBO analyses of both the House and Senate bills indicate that, in part
because of the creation of the exchanges and the expansion in Medicaid,
more than 30 million Americans who would otherwise be uninsured would
obtain coverage as a result of reform. These coverage expansions would
improve not only the health and the economic well-being of affected individuals and families, but also the broader economy.
A comprehensive body of literature demonstrates that being
uninsured leads to poorer medical treatment, worse health status, and
higher mortality rates. Across a range of acute conditions and chronic
diseases, uninsured Americans have worse outcomes, higher rates of
preventable death, and lower-quality care. Additionally, being uninsured
imposes on families a significant financial risk of bankruptcy caused by
medical expenses.
Evidence from the state of Massachusetts—which expanded health
insurance to all but 2.6 percent of its population in a 2006 reform effort—
finds that expanding coverage increased regular medical care and lowered
financial burdens for residents who gained coverage. Only 17.4 percent of
adults with family incomes of less than 300 percent of the Federal poverty
line reported forgoing care because of costs in 2008, compared with
27.3 percent in the pre-reform baseline in 2006 (Long and Masi 2009).
Taken together, this evidence strongly suggests that expanding
coverage for Americans through health insurance reform would directly
benefit millions of families by giving them access to the care they need
to maintain their health without substantial financial burdens and risks.
Moreover, because of the fixed costs of developing health care infrastructure
such as trauma centers, increasing the share of people with health insurance
can improve health outcomes for people with insurance as well.

206  |  Chapter 7

Beyond the improvements for individuals and families,
coverage expansions would produce benefits that extend throughout
the entire economy. A CEA report in June 2009 estimated that
economic gains from reduced financial risk for the uninsured totaled
$40 billion per year (Council of Economic Advisers 2009a). Moreover, the
CEA report found an economic value of more than $180 billion per year
from averting preventable deaths caused by a lack of insurance. Taken
together, these gains would far exceed the cost of extending coverage to the
currently uninsured population.
The economic benefits of expanding coverage would extend to labor
markets in the form of reduced absenteeism and greater productivity.
According to the 2009 March Current Population Survey, 18.7 million nonelderly adults report having one or more disabilities that prevent or limit
the work they can perform; of that total, 3.1 million lack health insurance.
Approximately 50 percent of non-elderly adults who work report having at
least one serious medical condition. Previous research has documented the
indirect costs to employers of health-related productivity losses. Some of
the costliest conditions—depression, migraines, and asthma—can often be
effectively managed with prescription medications made more affordable
by health insurance. This suggests that expanding access to coverage would
improve productivity and labor supply by creating a healthier workforce that
would lose fewer hours to preventable illnesses or disabilities.

Reducing the Growth Rate of Health Care Costs in the Public and
Private Sectors
The House and Senate bills contain a number of provisions that would
reduce the growth rate of health care spending in both the public and private
sectors. Both bills create pilot programs in Medicare to bundle provider
payments for an episode of care rather than for individual procedures.
Under bundled payments, Medicare would provide a single reimbursement for an entire episode of care rather than multiple reimbursements
for individual treatments. This payment strategy would give providers,
organized around a hospital or group of physicians, a stronger incentive to
coordinate and provide quality care efficiently rather than carry out lowvalue or unnecessary treatments and procedures. Recent research in the
New England Journal of Medicine suggests that bundled payments could
improve quality and substantially reduce health care spending (Hussey et
al. 2009). The Department of Health and Human Services would be given
authority to expand or extend successful pilot programs without additional
legislative action.

Reforming Health Care  |  207

Both bills also include measures that directly reduce waste in the
current health care system. One example of such waste is the substantial
overpayment to Medicare Advantage plans, which are currently paid an
average of 14 percent more per recipient than traditional Medicare. The
reform bills would reduce these overpayments, saving more than $100 billion
between 2010 and 2019 (Congressional Budget Office 2009b). Reducing
the overpayments would also lower Medicare recipients’ Part B premiums
below what they otherwise would be and would extend the solvency of the
Medicare Trust Fund.
Another component of the legislation that has the potential to
slow the growth rate of health care spending is the Independent Payment
Advisory Board included in the Senate bill. This board would have the
authority to propose changes to the Medicare program both to improve the
quality of care and to reduce the growth rate of program spending. Absent
Congressional action, these recommendations would be automatically
implemented.
Using the the CEA analysis of the House and Senate bills along
with projections from CBO about the level of Federal spending on
Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP, it is possible to estimate the effect of
reform on the growth rate of Federal health care spending. Recent CEA
analyses of the House and Senate bills find that reform would lower total
Federal spending on Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP by 2019 below what
it otherwise would have been (Council of Economic Advisers 2009b).
Moreover, between 2016 and 2019, both bills would lower the annual
growth rate of Federal spending on these programs by approximately
1.0 percentage point. State and local governments would also benefit
financially from health insurance reform, as described in Box 7-1.

Box 7-1: The Impact of Health Reform on State and Local Governments
Although slowing the growth in health care costs will help the longrun fiscal situation of the Federal Government, some observers worry
about how reform will affect state and local governments. To help ensure
that virtually all Americans receive health insurance, both the Senate and
the House bills call for expanding Medicaid eligibility. Because Medicaid
is partly funded by states, some state officials fear that the state fiscal
situation will deteriorate as a consequence of reform.
As documented by a CEA report published in September (Council
of Economic Advisers 2009d), however, health insurance reform would
Continued on next page

208  |  Chapter 7

Box 7-1, continued
improve the fiscal health of state and local governments in at least three
important ways. First, state and local governments are already spending
billions of dollars each year providing coverage to the uninsured; these
costs would fall significantly as a consequence of health reform. Second,
encouraging all individuals to become insured would reduce the hidden
tax paid by providers of health insurance. Because state and local governments employ more than 19 million people, the total savings from
removing the hidden tax is likely to be substantial. Third, an excise tax on
high-cost plans would boost workers’ wages by billions of dollars each year
and thus increase state income tax revenues.
To understand the net consequences of reform for the fiscal health
of state and local governments, the CEA studied the impact of reform for
16 states that are diverse along many important dimensions: geographic,
economic, and demographic. For every state studied, health reform would
result in substantial savings for state and local governments.

In addition to these public savings, the reform proposals would reduce
the growth of health care costs in the private sector. One important mechanism through which reform could reduce these costs is the excise tax on
high-cost insurance plans included in the Senate bill. Under current tax law,
employer compensation in the form of wages is subject to the income tax,
while compensation in the form of employer-provided health care benefits
is not. Individuals may therefore have an incentive to obtain more generous
health insurance than they would if wages and health insurance faced more
equal tax treatment. Absent other incentives for individuals to obtain insurance, the preferential tax treatment of health insurance may be beneficial,
because it encourages firms to provide health insurance to their workers
and facilitates pooling. Nonetheless, placing no limit on this subsidy likely
leads to health insurance that is more generous than would be efficient in
some cases.
To help contain the growth in the cost of these plans without
jeopardizing the risk-pooling benefits, the Senate bill would impose a tax
on only the most expensive employer-sponsored plans. Although only a
small share of plans would be affected, CEA estimates based on data from
the CBO suggest that the excise tax on high-cost insurance plans would
reduce the growth rate of annual health care costs in the private sector by
0.5 percentage point per year from 2012 to 2018. The excise tax would
encourage workers and their firms’ human resources departments to be
more watchful consumers and would give insurers a powerful incentive to
Reforming Health Care  |  209

price competitively. And to the extent that bundling, accountable care organizations, and other delivery system reforms in both the House and Senate
bills would spill over to the private sector, it is likely that the rate of growth
of health care spending in the private sector would fall by considerably more
than 0.5 percentage point per year. Lower increases in private health insurance premiums would lead to substantially higher take-home earnings for
workers.
Reform would also reduce private spending on health care in other
important ways. As noted, encouraging all individuals to obtain health
insurance would likely reduce average costs for people who are insured.
Reducing the hidden tax on health insurance premiums imposed by uncompensated care for the uninsured, for example, would reduce the financial
burden not only on state and local governments, but also on individuals.
CBO estimates of the Senate legislation find that reform has the power to
reduce small-group premiums by up to 2 percent and even large-group
premiums by up to 3 percent. And according to research by the Business
Roundtable, reforms similar to those included in both the House and Senate
bills could reduce employer-sponsored health insurance costs for family
coverage by as much as $3,000 per worker by 2019 relative to what those
costs otherwise would have been.

The Economic Benefits of Slowing the Growth Rate of Health
Care Costs
Reform as envisioned in both the House and Senate bills passed in
late 2009 would substantially lower the growth rate of health care spending.
Of course, spending would increase in the very short run as coverage was
extended to more than 30 million Americans who would otherwise be uninsured. But, according to the CBO, these temporary increases would soon
be more than offset by the slowdown in the growth rate of spending, with
the net savings increasing over time (Congressional Budget Office 2009b,
2009c).
A report released by the CEA in June 2009 demonstrated that slowing
the growth rate of health care costs would raise U.S. standards of living by
freeing up resources that could be used to produce other goods and services.
An examination of the cost reduction measures contained in the Senate bill
suggests that the typical family would see its income increase by thousands
of dollars per year by 2030. Total GDP would be substantially higher as well,
driven upward by both increased efficiency and increased national saving.
Slowing the growth rate of health care costs would also lower the
Federal budget deficit. Projections by the CBO of both the House and the
Senate legislation suggest that the bills would lower the deficit substantially
210  |  Chapter 7

in the upcoming decade, and even more in the next decade. These savings
would obviate large tax increases or cuts in other important priority areas.
As discussed in Chapter 5, it would be the single most important step toward
addressing the Nation’s long-run fiscal challenges.
Finally, reform that genuinely slows the growth of health care costs
could increase employment for a period of time by lowering the unemployment rate that is consistent with steady inflation. These effects could be
important, with CEA estimates suggesting an increase of more than 300,000
jobs for a period of time if health care costs grew by 1 percentage point less
each year.

Conclusion
In recent years, health care costs in the Nation’s private and public
sectors have been rising at an unsustainable rate, and the fraction of
Americans who are uninsured has steadily increased. These trends have
imposed tremendous burdens on individuals, employers, and governments
at every level, and the problems have grown yet more severe during the past
two years with the onset of the worst recession since the Great Depression.
Last year, the President signed into law several policies that have cushioned the worst of the economic downturn, including an expansion in the
Children’s Health Insurance Program and an extension of COBRA coverage
for displaced workers and their families. Other policies, such as increased
funding for health information technology, will improve the long-run
efficiency and quality of the health care sector.
Legislation passed by both the House and the Senate in late 2009
would expand health insurance coverage to tens of millions of Americans
while slowing the growth rate of health care costs. These reforms would
improve the health and the economic well-being of individuals and families,
help small businesses, stimulate job creation, and ease strains on Federal,
state, and local governments imposed by rapidly rising health care costs.

STRENGTHENING THE
AMERICAN LABOR FORCE

T

he recession has been extremely difficult for American workers and
families. One in ten workers is now unemployed, wages and hours
worked have fallen, and many families are struggling to make ends meet.
Making matters worse, the recession followed a sustained period of rising
inequality and stagnation in the living standards of typical American
workers. A central challenge in coming years will be to smooth the
transition to a sustainable growth path with more widely shared prosperity.
As we begin to recover from the recession, we will see a new and
much-changed labor market. Some industries that grew unsustainably
large in recent years, such as construction and finance, will recover but will
not immediately return to past employment levels. The same may be true
for traditional manufacturing, which has been shrinking as a share of the
economy for decades. The pace of employment decline will surely moderate
after the recession, but many former workers in traditional manufacturing
will need to transition into new, growing sectors.
In the place of the declining industries will come new opportunities
for American workers. Health care will remain an important source of
growth in the labor market, as will high-technology sectors including clean
energy industries and advanced manufacturing. Well-trained and highly
skilled workers will be best positioned to secure good jobs in these new and
growing sectors. The best way to prepare our workforce for the challenges
and opportunities that lie ahead is by strengthening our education system,
creating a seamless, efficient path for every American from childhood to
entry into the labor market as a skilled worker ready to meet the needs of
the new labor market.
Both individuals and the economy as a whole benefit from increased
educational attainment and improved school quality. A focus on access,
equity, and quality for all American students, from early childhood through
high school and into postsecondary education and training throughout
213

workers’ careers, will help ensure that the benefits of economic growth are
widely shared.

Challenges Facing American Workers
The last few years have been a challenging time for American workers,
with the high unemployment of the current recession compounding
longer-run trends toward increased insecurity and inequality.

Unemployment
As of December 2009, the unemployment rate was 10.0 percent, a rate
that has been exceeded only once since the Great Depression. As high as it
is, however, this rate understates just how weak the labor market is. Many
Americans who would like to work have given up hope of finding a job and
have dropped out of the labor force; others who would like full-time jobs
have settled for part-time work. Figure 8-1 shows both the conventional
unemployment rate and a broader measure of labor underutilization that
includes not just unemployed workers but also those who would like jobs

Notes: Grey shading indicates recessions. The overall unemployment rate represents the share of
the labor force that is unemployed (those actively looking for work). The broad unemployment
rate is a variant of the overall unemployment rate that adds marginally attached workers (those
not actively looking for a job, but want one and have looked for one recently) as well as workers
employed part-time for economic reasons to the numerator (the “unemployed”), and adds
marginally attached workers to the denominator (the “labor force”).

but have given up looking for work and those who are employed part-time
for economic reasons. This measure indicates that more than one in six
potential workers are unemployed or underemployed. Another measure of
labor market conditions that accounts for those who have given up looking
for work is the employment-to-population ratio. In December, fewer than
six in ten adults were employed, the lowest ratio since 1983. A final useful
labor market indicator is the number of long-term unemployed—those
without jobs for 27 weeks or more. More than one-third of unemployed
Americans have been seeking work for more than 26 weeks, the highest
share since the series began in 1948.
The employment situation is even worse for members of racial and
ethnic minorities. Figure 8-2 shows the unemployment rate for whites,
blacks, Hispanics, and Asians. While the unemployment rate for whites
topped out at 9.4 percent in October 2009 and has declined slightly since
then, the rate for blacks exceeds 16 percent and has continued to rise, while
that for Hispanics is nearly 13 percent. The disproportionate impact of the
current recession on blacks and Hispanics mirrors that seen in past business
cycles. It is critical that all Americans be able to participate fully and equally
in our economic recovery.

Strengthening the American Labor Force  |  215

Even a quick return to job growth will not immediately eliminate
employment problems, as it will take time to create the millions of new
jobs needed to return to normal employment levels. Many workers will
have difficulty finding work for some time to come. Extended periods of
high unemployment and low job creation rates mean that many displaced
workers will exhaust their unemployment insurance benefits before jobs
become available in large numbers. After months or even years of unemployment, most who exhaust their benefits will likely have used up whatever
savings they had when they lost their jobs. Many will be forced to turn to
public assistance—Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Supplemental
Nutritional Assistance (formerly known as food stamps), or other similar
programs—to make ends meet.
Sustained periods of low labor demand also have negative
repercussions for the long-run health of the economy. Mounting evidence
indicates that displacement during bad economic times leads to long-run
reductions in workers’ productivity (Jacobson, LaLonde, and Sullivan 1993),
likely because the displaced workers lose job skills, fall out of habits needed
for successful employment, and have trouble convincing employers that
they will be good employees. The resulting loss of “human capital” reduces
workers’ earning power, even after the economy recovers.
Deep downturns have particularly large effects on young Americans.
The unemployment rate for teenagers in December was 27.1 percent.
Research shows that teens who first enter the labor market during a
recession can have trouble getting their feet onto the first rung of the career
ladder, leaving them a step or more behind throughout their lives (Kahn
forthcoming; Oreopoulos, von Wachter, and Heisz 2006; Oyer 2006). There
is also evidence that when parents lose their jobs, their children’s long-run
economic opportunities suffer (Oreopoulos, Page, and Stevens 2008).

Sectoral Change
The Great Recession has aggravated an already challenging trend:
sectoral shifts that are changing the nature of work. While most American
workers were once engaged in producing food and manufactured goods,
often through physical labor that did not require a great deal of training,
the United States is increasingly a knowledge-based society where workers
produce services using analytical skills. The changing economy offers
tremendous opportunities for American workers in high technology, in the
new clean energy economy, in health care, and in other high-skill fields.
Accompanying these shifts in the composition of employment have
been changes in the institutions that govern the labor market. The prototypical American career once involved working for a single employer for many
216  |  Chapter 8

years, backed by a union that bargained for steady wage increases and for a
pension that promised a stable, guaranteed income in retirement. The labor
market has changed. Fewer than one in seven workers belongs to a union,
and most people can count on changing employers several times over their
careers. Moreover, the vast majority of retirement plans are now “defined
contribution,” meaning that workers’ retirement incomes depend on the
success of their individual investment decisions and on the performance
of asset markets as a whole. This shift has meant added risk for workers,
particularly those whose planned retirements coincide with downturns in
asset prices.

Stagnating Incomes for Middle-Class Families
A final major challenge facing American workers is the decades-long
stagnation in living standards for typical families and the related increase in
inequality. Figure 8-3 offers two looks at income trends over the past half
century. First, it shows real median family income—the level at which half
of families have higher income and half have lower income—over time. The
median rose steadily until 1970, but then the rate of growth slowed substantially, and since 2000, the median has actually fallen.
One determinant of family income is the number of individuals
working outside of the home. Female labor force participation has risen
dramatically: in 1960, just over 40 percent of adult women (aged 18–54)
participated in the labor force; by 2000, approximately three-quarters did.
This increase in female labor force participation contributed to the rise in
family incomes. However, the female labor force participation rate has been
roughly stable since 2000, and there are not likely to be future increases in
participation as dramatic as those seen in the past. Further increases in
family incomes will likely rely on growth in individual earnings.
The other two series in Figure 8-3 show the median earnings for
men and women working full-time, year-round jobs. Real median female
year-round earnings have grown steadily by about 1.1 percent per year on
average since 1960, reflecting in part the gradual leveling of labor market
barriers to women’s career advancement. But real male earnings have been
essentially flat since the early 1970s. One source of the stagnation of median
male earnings and the reduced growth rate of median female earnings is
that productivity growth slowed betwen 1973 and 1995 (Chapter 10). But
this is not a complete explanation. Even at a reduced growth rate, American
workers’ productivity has more than doubled in the last 40 years.
A partial explanation for the divergence between productivity and
earnings is the rapid rise in health care costs in recent years: an ever-greater
share of the compensation paid by employers has gone toward health

insurance premiums, which have risen much faster than inflation. This
makes health reform an urgent priority. As discussed in Chapter 7, the
proposals under consideration in Congress will slow the growth in health
care costs, allowing American workers to realize more of the benefits of their
hard work through increased take-home pay.
A second explanation is that per capita earnings are distributed in
an increasingly unequal way, with ever-smaller shares going to workers in
the middle and bottom of the distribution (Kopczuk, Saez, and Song forthcoming). Earnings inequality is compounded by inequality in nonlabor
income, including dividends, interest, and capital gains. Figure 8-4 shows
that in recent years nearly half of all income—including both wages and
salaries and nonlabor income—has gone to 10 percent of families. The top
1 percent of families now receive nearly 25 percent of income, up from
less than 10 percent in the 1970s (Piketty and Saez 2003). Today’s income
concentration is of a form not seen since the 1920s. Although there is
nothing inherently wrong with high incomes at the top of the distribution,
they are problematic if they come at the expense of the rest of workers.
A major challenge for American public policy is to ensure that prosperity is
again broadly shared.

Policies to Support Workers
The Administration’s first priority upon taking office was to strengthen
the economy and the labor market, helping to provide jobs for those
who need them. According to Council of Economic Advisers estimates,
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 had created or saved
between 1.5 million and 2 million jobs as of the fourth quarter of 2009
(Council of Economic Advisers 2010).
At the same time, the Administration has worked to strengthen the
safety net for those who remain unemployed. The Recovery Act provided
unprecedented support for the jobless, with increased benefits for every
unemployment insurance recipient, the longest extension of unemployment
benefits in history, an expansion of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program, and assistance with health insurance premiums for those who
have lost their jobs. These provisions have directly helped millions of outof-work Americans pay for housing, put food on the table, and maintain
access to medical care. Moreover, because the unemployed are likely to
spend any benefits they receive, these provisions have supported increased

net provisions in the Recovery Act are scheduled to expire at the end of
Strengthening the American Labor Force  |  219

February 2010, but because of the ongoing weakness in the labor market, the
Administration is working with Congress to extend them further.
The Recovery Act also included provisions to reform the
unemployment insurance system, making it work more effectively in today’s
economy. These provisions extend unemployment insurance eligibility to
many low-wage and part-time workers who were not previously eligible.
These and other recent initiatives will also make it possible for many unemployed workers to draw out-of-work benefits while participating in training
that prepares them to enter new fields.
Even after the labor market recovers, the dynamic American economy
will continue to pose challenges—while also creating opportunities—for
workers. Rapid technological change will cause shifts in the labor market,
forcing some workers into unanticipated mid-life career changes. Policy can
help to ease these transitions. Most important, it can ensure that workers who
may switch careers several times during their lifetimes are able to maintain
health insurance and to support themselves in retirement. As discussed in
Chapter 7, comprehensive health care reform will eliminate preexisting conditions restrictions in health insurance and improve access to insurance in the
individual market. These changes will make it much easier for people to maintain insurance when they change jobs or pursue entrepreneurial opportunities.
Declines in stock prices and home values have put serious pressure
on many Americans’ retirement plans and have highlighted the importance
of improved retirement security. The Administration has proposed several
measures to increase saving by low- and middle-income workers. Efforts
include expanded access to retirement plans along with rule changes to
streamline enrollment in 401(k) and IRA programs, facilitate simple saving
strategies, and reorient program default options to emphasize saving. And,
most important, the Administration is committed to protecting Social
Security, thus ensuring that it can provide a reliable source of income for
future retirees, as it has for their parents and grandparents.
Health and retirement security need to be accompanied by labor
market institutions that support and protect workers. Labor unions have
long been a force helping to raise standards of living for middle-class
families. They remain important, and we need to reinforce the principle that
workers who wish to join a union should have the right to do so.
Another set of institutions in need of attention is our immigration
system. The current framework absorbs considerable resources but does
not serve anyone—native workers, employers, taxpayers, or potential
immigrants—well. Particular problems are posed by the presence of large
numbers of unauthorized immigrants and the lengthy queues—some over
20 years—for legal residency.
220  |  Chapter 8

Reform of the immigration system can strengthen our economy and
labor market. Reform should provide a path for those who are currently here
illegally to come out of the shadows. It should include strengthened border
controls and better enforcement of laws against employing undocumented
workers, along with programs to help immigrants and their children quickly
integrate into their communities and American society. Future immigration policy should be more responsive to our economy’s changing needs.
Reform of the employment-based visa and permanent residency programs
will also help reduce the incentives to immigrate illegally by giving potential
immigrants a more viable legal path into the United States.

Education and Training:
The Groundwork for Long-Term Prosperity
Rebuilding our economy on a more sustainable basis, investing in
future productivity, fostering technological and other forms of innovation,
and reforming our health care system to deliver better outcomes at lower costs
are all crucial to long-run increases in living standards, and all are discussed
elsewhere in this report. But one fundamental component of a strategy to
ensure balanced, sustained, and widely shared growth is a robust system of
education and training. The positive link between education and worker
productivity—the cornerstone of economic prosperity—is well established.
In fact, research has credited education with up to one-third of the productivity growth in the United States from the 1950s to the 1990s (Jones 2002).

Benefits of Education
At the individual level, there is a strong relationship between
educational attainment and earnings (Card 1999). The earnings premium
shows up at all levels of education. Those who complete one year of postsecondary education earn more than those who stop after high school,
while those who complete two years or finish degrees earn more still. And
job training for the unemployed has been shown by rigorous studies to
raise participants’ future earnings (Manpower Demonstration Research
Corporation 1983; Jacobson, LaLonde, and Sullivan 2005).
The earnings premium associated with education is far larger than
the cost—in tuition and forgone earnings—of remaining in school (Barrow
and Rouse 2005), and it has grown in recent decades. Figure 8-5 shows
the trends in the average annual earnings of individuals with high school
diplomas but no college and of those with bachelor’s degrees. In the mid1960s, college graduates earned roughly 50 percent more than high school
graduates, on average; by 2008, the premium had more than doubled.

Education has other important benefits besides increased earnings.
For example, recent studies have found that education improves people’s
health (Cutler and Lleras-Muney 2006; Grossman 2005). The explanation
may be that better educated people make better health-related decisions,
such as exercising or not smoking, or that education allows for easier navigation of a complex health care system. Education’s benefits also extend
beyond the individual. More educated people commit fewer crimes, vote
more, and are more likely to support free speech (Dee 2004; Lochner
and Moretti 2004). They also make their neighbors and coworkers more
productive (Moretti 2004).

Trends in U.S. Educational Attainment
The United States has historically had the world’s best education
system. Although most European countries once limited advanced education to the economic elite, the United States has historically made it broadly
available. U.S secondary schools have been free and generally accessible since early in the 20th century. By the 1950s, nearly 80 percent of
older teens (aged 15–19) in the United States were enrolled in secondary
school, compared with fewer than 40 percent in Western Europe. The

222  |  Chapter 8

widespread expansion of state colleges and universities, begun under the
Morrill Land Grant Act of 1862, led to even further advances in American
education. Average educational attainment of people born in 1975 was
over five years higher than that of those born in 1895. About 50 percent
of the gain was attributable to increases in high school education, about
30 percent to increases in college and postcollege education, and the
remainder to continued increases in elementary education (Goldin and Katz
2008). During the second half of the 20th century, as educational attainment rose worldwide, the United States became a clear leader in graduate
education, attracting the brightest students from around the world. Some
remained in the United States, adding importantly to the Nation’s human
capital stock and its diversity, while others returned to their home countries
and used the education they got here to help increase prosperity there.
Harvard economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz contend that
America’s strong educational system helped make the United States the
richest nation in the world (Goldin and Katz 2008). Over the past several
decades, however, U.S. leadership in education has slipped. Although the
Nation remains preeminent in postgraduate education, we can no longer
claim to be home to the most educated people in the world.
For decades, the number of educated American workers grew faster
than did the demand for them. But beginning with the cohort that completed
its schooling in the early 1970s, the growth rate in the supply of educated
Americans slowed significantly. This can be seen in Figure 8-6, which shows
the mean years of schooling of Americans by year of birth. High school
and college graduation rates, which grew steadily for many decades, began
to stagnate, and younger generations no longer graduate at significantly
higher rates than did previous generations. This slowdown in the growth of
educational attainment has contributed to rising income inequality, as the
shortage of college-educated workers has meant rising wages for high-skill
work and falling wages for work requiring less education. The current recession may provide an opportunity to reverse this slowdown but only if our
education system can keep up with increased demand (Box 8-1).
Meanwhile, other developed countries have continued to improve
their educational outcomes, and the United States has slipped behind several
other advanced countries at both the high school and postsecondary levels.
Among the cohort born between 1943 and 1952—a group that largely
completed its education by the late 1970s—the United States leads the world
in the share with at least a bachelor’s degree or the equivalent. In more
recent cohorts, the percentage completing college has been roughly stable
in the United States while increasing substantially in several peer countries.

Box 8-1: The Recession’s Impact on the Education System
Today’s weak labor market is likely to lead to short- and mediumrun increases in school enrollments, as high unemployment pushes
many young people to increase their job skills through further education.
Indeed, college enrollments rose substantially in 2008 relative to 2007,
and preliminary reports suggest further increases in 2009. The resulting
increase in educational attainment will offer long-run benefits for the
economy, because today’s students will be more productive workers when
labor demand returns to full strength.
In the short run, however, elevated enrollments are placing strains
on colleges, particularly the two-year colleges that are seeing most of the
enrollment increase, as colleges’ costs are rising at the same time state

Box 8-1, continued
funding is being cut. Elementary and secondary schools are under similar
strains. In part because of reduced state funding, schools employed
roughly 70,000 fewer teachers and teachers’ assistants in October 2009 than
a year earlier, even though student enrollments were up. The reduction in
per-pupil resources at both levels is an unfortunate budgetary response. At
this time of high unemployment, it is desirable to encourage human capital
formation, not make it more difficult. The State Fiscal Stabilization Fund,
part of the Recovery Act, is helping in this regard, and recipients credit
the Act with creating or saving at least 325,000 education jobs through the
third quarter of 2009.

United States slipping from the top rank to the middle in recent decades.

U.S. Student Achievement
U.S. student achievement, as measured by assessments that capture
how much students know at particular ages or grades, has improved notably
in recent years, even as attainment has stagnated. The most reliable barometer is the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP), which has
been administered consistently for more than three decades. Figure 8-8
shows average NAEP math scores for students at three different ages from
1978 through 2008. The performance of 9-year-olds (who are typically
enrolled in 4th grade) and 13-year-olds (typically 8th grade) has improved
over the past 35 years. The size of the achievement gains is impressive. Nearly
three-quarters of 13-year-olds in 2008 scored above the 1978 median, with
similar gains throughout the distribution. The performance of 17-year-olds
(typically 12th graders) has also improved, although the gain was smaller.
Despite recent progress, American students are not doing as well
as they should. In addition to average performance, the NAEP program
measures the fraction of students who attain target achievement levels
defined based on the skills that children at each age and grade should have
mastered. A student is judged “proficient” if he or she demonstrates age- or
grade-appropriate competency over challenging subject matter and shows
an ability to apply knowledge to real-world situations. In the most recent
tests, only 31 percent of 8th graders were proficient in reading and only
34 percent in math. Proficiency rates are similar in 4th grade.
For some subgroups, proficiency rates were much lower. Only
12 percent of black students and 17 percent of Hispanics were proficient in
math in 8th grade. The low achievement in these subgroups is also reflected
in low attainment. In 2000, only 81 percent of black young adults (aged
30–34) had graduated from high school, and only 15 percent had bachelor’s
degrees. Although racial and ethnic gaps have narrowed importantly in
recent decades—the black-white and Hispanic-white mathematics gaps at
age 13 in the NAEP long-term trend data are each only two-thirds as large
as in 1978—the low attainment and achievement of black and Hispanic
students remain disturbing evidence of educational inequality in our society.
Our future prosperity depends on ensuring that American children from all
backgrounds have the opportunity to become productive workers.
Nowhere does low performance more acutely affect the health of
the U.S. economy than in the areas of science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics (known commonly by the acronym STEM). Employers
frequently report that they have difficulty finding Americans with the
qualifications needed for technical jobs and are forced to look abroad for
suitably skilled workers. Indeed, international comparisons show that
other countries achieve higher outcomes in STEM skills than we do. In

2006, U.S. 15-year-olds scored well below the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) average for science literacy on
the Programme for International Student Assessment, and behind most
other OECD nations on critical skills and competencies, such as explaining
scientific phenomena and using scientific evidence.

A Path Toward Improved
Educational Performance
Concerned about the impact of stagnating educational outcomes on
U.S. economic growth, the President has pledged to return our Nation to
the path of increasing educational attainment. He has challenged every
young American to commit to at least one year of higher education or
career training. He also has set ambitious goals: by 2020, America should
“once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world”
(Obama 2009a), and U.S. students should move “from the middle to the top

Strengthening the American Labor Force  |  227

of the pack in science and math” (Obama 2009b). Meeting these challenges
will require substantial commitment and reform, not just at the postsecondary level but also in elementary and high schools and even in early
childhood programs.

Postsecondary Education
The Nation’s postsecondary education system encompasses a diverse
group of institutions, including public, nonprofit, and for-profit organizations offering education ranging from short-term skill refresher programs
up to doctoral degrees.
In many of our peer countries, postsecondary education is entirely or
largely state funded, with little direct cost to the student. U.S. postsecondary
students, however, are generally charged tuition and fees, which have risen
substantially in real terms over the past three decades. It is important to
keep in mind that most of our students do not pay full tuition, as more than
60 percent of full-time students receive grant aid, and millions more also
benefit from Federal tax credits and deductions for tuition. But increases
in financial aid and Federal assistance have not kept up with rising costs,
and the net price of attendance at four-year public colleges has risen nearly
20 percent over the past decade (College Board 2009).
Young people may have trouble financing expensive investments
in college education even when these investments will pay off through
increased long-term earnings. Thus, rising college costs represent an
important barrier to enrollment. One study indicates that a $1,000 reduction in net college costs increases the probability of attending college
by 5 percentage points and leads students to complete about one-fifth
of a year more college (Dynarski 2003). Thus the dramatic increase
in the price of college has likely had an adverse impact on college
attendance and completion. Moreover, the impact of cost increases is
not evenly distributed: while students from high-income families can
relatively easily absorb the increases, students from lower-income families are
disproportionately deterred.
The rising cost of college is affecting educational attainment and
will continue to do so unless we find ways to make college more affordable. To this end, the Administration has secured historic investments in
student aid, including more than $100 billion over the next 10 years for
more generous Pell Grants, much of it financed through the elimination of
wasteful subsidies to private lenders in the student loan program. This will
ensure that virtually all students eligible for Pell Grants will receive larger
awards. In addition, the Administration is taking steps to dramatically
simplify the student aid application process, the complexity of which deters
228  |  Chapter 8

many aid-eligible students from even applying. This simplification will
help millions more students benefit from the Federal investments in college
accessibility and affordability.
Tuition is not the only barrier to college completion. A great many
students, including nearly half of those at two-year institutions, begin college
but fail to graduate. Completion rates are particularly low for low-income
students. One way to raise completion rates is through better design of
the institutional environment. Recent rigorous studies have shown that
improvements such as enhanced student services, changes in how classes are
organized, innovations in how remedial education is structured, and basing
some portion of financial aid on student performance can all contribute to
improved persistence (Scrivener et al. 2008; Scrivener, Sommo, and Collado
2009; Richburg-Hayes et al. 2009).

Training and Adult Education
An often-overlooked component of the Nation’s education system,
one in which the government makes a major investment, is job training
and adult education. In 2009, the Federal Government devoted more than
$17 billion to job training and employment services and spent substantial
additional funds on Pell Grants for vocational and adult education students.
Training is provided by a diverse set of institutions, including proprietary
(for-profit) schools, four-year colleges, community-based organizations,
and public vocational and technical schools. Box 8-2 discusses a particularly
important type of training provider, community colleges.
Studies have documented that training and adult education programs
improve participants’ labor market outcomes. For example, a recent study
found that Workforce Investment Act training programs for adults boosted
employment and earnings, on average, although results varied substantially
across states (Heinrich, Mueser, and Troske 2008). Evidence is also growing
that state training programs for adults can have large positive impacts on
long-term earnings (Hotz, Imbens, and Klerman 2006; Dyke et al. 2006).
Education and training for adults play critical roles in helping
displaced workers regain employment in the short term and in helping
them obtain and refresh their skills in the face of an ever-changing workplace. For example, one study of displaced workers in Washington State
suggests that attending a community college after displacement during the
1990s increased long-term earnings about 9 percent for men and about
13 percent for women (Jacobson, LaLonde, and Sullivan 2005). The benefits
were greatest for academic courses in math and science, as well as for courses
related to the health professions, technical trades (such as air conditioner
repair), and technical professions (such as software development).
Strengthening the American Labor Force  |  229

Although research demonstrates the value of training programs, there
is no doubt that the current system could be more effective. Five strategies
that could improve effectiveness are: aligning goals across different elements
of the education and training system and constructing a cumulative curriculum; collaborating with employers to ensure that curricula are aligned with
workforce needs and regional economies; making sure that scheduling is flexible and that curricula meet the needs of older and nontraditional students;
providing incentives and flexibility for institutions and programs to continually improve and innovate; and establishing a stronger accountability system
that measures the right things, makes performance data available in an easily
understood format, and does not create perverse incentives to avoid serving
populations that most need assistance. Reauthorization of the Workforce
Investment Act will provide an opportunity to implement these strategies.
Box 8-2: Community Colleges: A Crucial Component of
Our Higher Education System
Community colleges are an important but often overlooked
component of the Nation’s postsecondary education system. These
colleges may offer academic programs preparing students to transfer to
four-year colleges to complete bachelor’s degrees, academic and vocational
programs leading to terminal associate’s degrees or certificates, remedial
education for those who want to attend college but who left high school
insufficiently prepared, and short-term job training or other educational
experiences. Most also offer contract training in which they work directly
with the public sector, employers, and other clients (such as prisons) to
develop and provide training for specific occupations or purposes.
Community colleges are public institutions that typically charge very
low tuition and primarily serve commuters, which makes them accessible
to people who do not have the resources for a four-year college. They
generally have “open door” admissions policies, requiring only a high
school diploma or an ability to benefit from the educational experience.
This makes them a good choice for older and nontraditional students, as
well as for potential students who want to pursue additional education and
build their human capital but want or need to do so at relatively low cost.
More than 35 percent of first-time college freshmen enroll at
community colleges. These colleges also serve about 35 percent of individuals receiving job training through the Workforce Investment Act,
along with a notable proportion of adults attending adult basic education,
English as a second language, and General Educational Development

Box 8-2, continued
(GED) preparation classes. Researchers have estimated that attending a
community college significantly raises earnings, even for individuals who
do not complete degrees (Kane and Rouse 1999; Marcotte et al. 2005).
Community colleges will form the linchpin of efforts to increase
college attendance and graduation rates. The Administration has proposed
a new program of competitive grants for implementing college completion
initiatives, with a focus on community colleges. Along with the sorts
of strategies mentioned above for training programs more generally,
community college initiatives could include building better partnerships
between colleges, businesses, the workforce investment system, and other
workforce partners to create career pathways for workers; expanding
course offerings including those built on partnerships between colleges
and high schools; and stronger accountability for results. These strategies
will help both to strengthen colleges and to raise completion rates. The
proposed program also recognizes the need to learn from such investment
and therefore supports record levels of funding for research to evaluate the
initiatives’ effectiveness.

Elementary and Secondary Education
Students who leave high school with inadequate academic preparation
face greater challenges to success in postsecondary training. In 2001, nearly
one-third of first-year college students in the United States needed to take
remedial classes in reading, writing, or mathematics, at an estimated cost
of more than $1 billion (Bettinger and Long 2007). The need for remediation is a clear warning sign that a student may later drop out. In one study,
students who needed the most remediation were only about half as likely to
complete college as their peers who were better prepared (Adelman 1998).
Of course, students who leave high school well prepared are more successful
in the labor market as well as in college.
The task of improving college and labor market preparedness begins
in elementary and secondary school, if not earlier. Among the most
important contributors to enhanced student outcomes is effective teaching.
Common sense and research both recognize the importance of high-quality
teachers, and yet too few teachers reach that standard. Improvements
are needed in teacher training, recruitment, evaluation, and in-service
professional development.
Not only is the supply of high-quality teachers insufficient but their
distribution across schools is inequitable. Frequently, schools with high
Strengthening the American Labor Force  |  231

concentrations of minority and low-income students, the very schools that
need quality teachers the most, cannot recruit and retain skilled educators.
In New York State, 21 percent of black students had teachers who failed their
general knowledge certification exam on the first attempt, compared with
7 percent of white students (Lankford, Loeb, and Wyckoff 2002). A particular problem is high teacher turnover: high-poverty and high-minority
schools have much higher turnover than do schools with more advantaged
students. Some districts have begun experimenting with financial incentives for teaching in high-need schools; these efforts need to be rigorously
evaluated and, if they are found to be successful, disseminated widely.
Improving teacher quality, however, is not the only promising strategy
for change. Others include extending both the school day and the school
year. Many successful strategies have emerged from schools that were given
freedom to explore new and creative approaches to long-standing problems.
Although traditional public schools can be agents for change, the public
charter school model is tailor-made for such innovation. The Nation’s
experience with charter schools has been fairly brief, but evidence to date
suggests that some of these schools have found successful strategies for
raising student achievement. An important future challenge will be to take
these strategies and other innovative school models to scale, even as schools
continue to search for ever-better approaches.
Although most reforms in recent years have focused on elementary
schools, high school reform is now rising to the top of the education policy
agenda. Promising approaches to improving secondary education include
programs that offer opportunities for accelerated instruction and individualized learning, programs to expand access to early college coursework before
finishing high school, residential schools for disadvantaged students, and
specialty career-focused academies.
An environment that supports innovation must be coupled with
strong accountability. Some innovations are bound to be unsuccessful, and
indeed there is substantial variation in the quality of both public and charter
schools. Strong accountability systems that promote effective instructional
approaches can provide incentives for all school stakeholders to perform at
their best and help to identify struggling schools in need of intervention.
Systems are needed to identify failing schools, based on high-quality student
assessments as well as other metrics. At the same time, accountability
strategies must be carefully crafted to discourage “teaching to the test” and
other approaches that aim at the measures used for evaluating schools rather
than at true student learning. Accountability strategies must also recognize
that student achievement reflects family, community, and peer influences as
well as that of the school.
232  |  Chapter 8

Providing incentives for schools identified as failing to improve can
significantly improve student outcomes. Several states have done just that.
Sixteen years ago, Massachusetts began setting curriculum frameworks
and holding schools accountable for student performance. Massachusetts
students have historically scored above the national average on various
academic achievement measures, but since passing school accountability
reform, Massachusetts has moved even farther ahead. In Florida, too, a
strong school accountability plan, implemented in 1999, has shown positive
results (Figlio and Rouse 2006; Rouse et al. 2007).
The Recovery Act included an unprecedented Federal investment
in elementary and secondary education. The Race to the Top Fund
provides competitive grants to reward and encourage states that have
taken strong measures to improve teacher quality, develop meaningful
incentives, incorporate data into decisionmaking, and raise student achievement in low-achieving schools. The upcoming reauthorization of the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act provides an opportunity to make
further progress.

Early Childhood Education
High-quality elementary and secondary schools are necessary, but
they are not enough. In recent years, researchers and educators have learned
a great deal about how important the school readiness of entering kindergarteners is to later academic and labor market success. School readiness
involves both academic skills, as measured by vocabulary size, complexity of
spoken language, and basic counting, and social and emotional skills such
as the ability to follow directions and self-regulate. Children who arrive
at school without these skills lack the foundation on which later learning
will build.
Recent research indicates that as many as 45 percent of entering
kindergarteners are ill-prepared to succeed in school (Hair et al. 2006).
Reducing the share of at-risk preschoolers is critical to strengthening
America’s educational system and its labor market in the long run. Highquality early childhood interventions can significantly improve school
readiness, especially for low-income children. Intensive programs that
combine high-quality preschool with home visits and parenting support
have been shown to raise children’s later test scores and educational
attainment and also to reduce teen pregnancy rates and criminality (Karoly
et al. 1998; Schweinhart et al. 1985).
The programs on which the most compelling research is based
include small classes, highly educated teachers with training in early childhood education, and stimulating curricula. They feature parent training

components that help parents reinforce what the teachers do in the classroom. The programs also assist teachers in identifying health and behavior
problems that can inhibit children’s intellectual and emotional development. Importantly, even intensive, expensive programs are cost-effective.
For example, one particularly intensive program was found to produce
$2.50 in long-run savings for taxpayers for every dollar spent, because in
adulthood the participating children earned higher incomes, used fewer
educational and government resources, and had lower health care costs
(Barnett and Masse 2007).
Less intensive programs can be effective as well.  The Head Start
program provides an academically enriching preschool environment for
3- and 4-year-olds, at a cost in 2008 of only about $7,000 per child per year. 
Although the quality of Head Start centers varies widely, studies have found
that attendance at a well-run center improves children’s later-life outcomes
(Currie and Thomas 1995). 
Ensuring that all families have access to the services and support they
need to help prepare their children for kindergarten will require a strong
system of high-quality preschools and other early-learning centers. Providers
must be held to high standards and given the resources—including qualified staff and teachers—needed for success. And when children leave their
preschool and prekindergarten programs, they must have access to quality
kindergartens that ease the transition to elementary school.

Conclusion
The recession has taken a severe toll on American workers and many
will continue to suffer from its effects for some time to come. A strong safety
net will be essential to helping working families through this trying time. As
the economy strengthens, we must rebuild our labor market institutions in
ways that ensure that prosperity and economic security are more widely shared.
Going forward, workers who have strong analytic and interactive
skills will be best able to secure good jobs and to contribute to continued
U.S. prosperity. Education must begin in preschool, because children’s
long-run success depends on arriving in kindergarten ready to learn, and be
available throughout adulthood, because our increasingly dynamic economy
requires lifelong learning. The Administration’s education agenda will
strengthen our education and training institutions at all levels.

TRANSFORMING THE ENERGY
SECTOR AND ADDRESSING
CLIMATE CHANGE

T

he President has called climate change “one of the defining challenges
of our time.” If steps are not taken to reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases, scientists project
that the world could face a significant increase in the global average surface
temperature. Projections indicate that CO2 concentrations may double
from pre-industrial levels as early as 2050, and that the higher concentrations are associated with a likely long-run temperature increase of 2 to 4.5
°C (3.6 to 8.1 °F). With temperatures at that level, climate change will lead
to a range of negative impacts, including increased mortality rates, reduced
agricultural yields in many parts of the world, and rising sea levels that could
inundate low-lying coastal areas.
The planet has not experienced such rapid warming on a global scale
in many thousands of years, and never as a result of emissions from human
activity. By far the largest contribution to this warming comes from carbonintensive fossil fuels, which the world depends on for cooking, heating
and cooling homes and offices, transportation, generating electricity, and
manufacturing products such as cement and steel.
The potential for significant damages if emissions from these activities are not curbed makes it crucial for the world to transform the energy
sector. This transformation will entail developing entirely new industries
and making major changes in the way energy is produced, distributed, and
used. New technologies will be developed and new jobs created. The United
States can play a leadership role in these efforts and become a world leader
in clean energy technologies. The transformation to a clean energy economy
will also reduce our Nation’s dependence on oil and improve national
security, and could reduce other pollutants in addition to greenhouse gases.
As this transformation unfolds, two market failures provide a
motivation for government policy. First, greenhouse gas emissions are a

235

classic example of a negative externality. As emitters of greenhouse gases
contribute to climate change, they impose costs on others that are not taken
into account when making decisions about how to produce and consume
energy-intensive goods. Second, the development of new technologies has
positive externalities. As discussed in Chapter 10, the developers of new
technologies generally capture much less than the full benefit of their ideas
to consumers, firms, and future innovators, and thus underinvest in research
and development.
This diagnosis of the market failures underlying climate change
provides clear guidance about the role of policy in the area. First, policy
should take steps to ensure that the market provides the correct signals
to greenhouse gas emitters about the full cost of their emissions. Second,
policy should actively promote the development of new technologies.
One way to accomplish these goals is through a market-based approach
to reducing greenhouse gases combined with government incentives to
promote research and development of new clean energy technologies.
Once policy has ensured that markets are providing the correct signals
and incentives, the operation of market forces can find the most effective
and efficient paths to the clean energy economy. The Administration’s
policies in this area are guided by these principles.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Climate,
and Economic Well-Being
The world’s dependence on carbon-intensive fuels is projected to
continue to increase global average temperature as greenhouse gas emissions build in the atmosphere. These emissions are particularly problematic
because many are long-lived: for instance, it will take a century for slightly
more than half of the carbon dioxide now in the atmosphere to be naturally
removed. The atmospheric buildup of greenhouse gases since the start of
the industrial revolution has already raised average global temperature by
roughly 0.8 °C (1.4 °F). If the concentrations of all greenhouse gases and
aerosols resulting from human activity could somehow be kept constant
at current levels, the temperature would still go up about another 0.4 ⁰C
(0.7 °F) by the end of the century. It is important to note that the overall
impact of today’s emissions would be even higher were it not for the offsetting net cooling effect of increases in atmospheric aerosols such as particulate
matter caused by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels in coal-fired
power plants.
But keeping atmospheric concentrations constant at today’s level is
virtually impossible. Any additional greenhouse gas emissions contribute
236  |  Chapter 9

to atmospheric concentrations. And because of projected economic
growth, particularly in developing countries, greenhouse gas emissions
will continue to grow. Moreover, the sources of atmospheric aerosols
that have partly offset the greenhouse warming experienced so far are not
likely to grow apace because governments around the world are taking
actions to curb these emissions to improve public health and control
acid rain.

Greenhouse Gases
The principal long-lived greenhouse gases whose concentrations have
been affected by human activity are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide,
and halocarbons. Sulfur hexafluoride, though emitted in smaller quantities,
is also a very potent greenhouse gas. All have increased significantly from
pre-industrial levels. Carbon dioxide is emitted when fossil fuel is burned
to heat and cool homes, fuel vehicles, and manufacture products such as
cement and steel. Deforestation also releases carbon dioxide stored in trees
and soil. The primary sources of methane and nitrous oxide are agricultural
practices, natural gas use, and landfills. Halocarbons originate from refrigeration and industrial processes, while sulfur hexafluoride emissions mainly
stem from electrical and industrial applications.
The pre-industrial atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide was
about 280 parts per million (ppm), meaning that 280 out of every million
molecules of gas in the atmosphere were carbon dioxide. As of December
2009, its concentration had increased to about 387 ppm. Taking into account
other long-lived greenhouse gases would result in a higher warming potential, but the net cooling effect of aerosols that have been added by humans
to the atmosphere nearly cancels the effect of those other gases. Thus, the
overall effect of human activity on the atmosphere to date is (coincidentally)
about the same as that of the carbon dioxide increase alone.
A variety of models project that, absent climate policy, atmospheric
concentrations of carbon dioxide will continue to grow, reaching levels
ranging from 610 to 1030 ppm by 2100 (Figure 9-1). When the warming
effects of other long-lived greenhouse gases are included, this range is
equivalent to 830 to 1530 ppm. The breadth of the range reflects uncertainty
about future energy supply, energy demand, and the future behavior of the
carbon cycle.1
1

Underlying uncertainty about future energy supply is uncertainty regarding the costs and
penetration rates of technology, and resource availability. Uncertainty about future energy
demand is driven by uncertainty regarding growth in population, gross domestic product, and
energy efficiency.

Temperature Change
The implications of large increases in greenhouse gas concentrations
for temperature change are quite serious. There is a consensus among scientists that a doubling of CO2 concentrations (or any equivalent combination
of greenhouse gases) above the pre-industrial level of 280 ppm is likely to
increase global average surface temperature by 2 to 4.5 °C (3.6 to 8.1 °F),
with a best estimate of about 3 °C (5.4 °F).2 Given much higher projections
of greenhouse gas concentrations by the end of the century, a recent study
projects that the global average temperature in 2100 is likely to be 4.2 to
8.1 °C (7.6 to 14.6 °F) above pre-industrial levels, absent effective policies to
reduce emissions (Webster et al. 2009).
Increases in global average temperature mask variability by region.
For instance, absent effective policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
mid-continent temperature increases are likely to be about 30 to 60 percent
higher than the global average, while increases in parts of the far North (for
instance, parts of Alaska, northern Canada, and Russia) are expected to
be double the global average. The power of the strongest hurricanes and

typhoons is likely to grow, as are the frequency and intensity of extreme
weather events such as heat waves, heavy precipitation, floods, and droughts.
One study, for example, estimates that the number of days that mean
temperature (calculated as the average of the daily minimum and daily
maximum) in the United States will exceed 90 °F will increase from about
one day a year between 1968 and 2002 to over 20 days a year by the end of
the century (Deschênes and Greenstone 2008).
As the increase in global average temperature warms seawater and
expands its volume, sea levels are projected to rise. Melting glaciers also
contribute to sea-level rise. Sea level has already risen about 0.6 feet since
1900; it is projected to rise another 0.6 to 1.9 feet because of volume expansion and glacial melt by the end of the century. These estimates exclude
possible rapid ice loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, events
that are highly uncertain but that could cause another 2 feet or more of sea
level rise by 2100. Without expensive adaptation, low-lying land in coastal
areas around the world could become permanently flooded as a result.

Impact on Economic Well-Being
Although predicting future economic impacts associated with increases
in global average temperature involves a large degree of uncertainty, these
economic effects are likely to be significant and largely negative, and to vary
substantially by region. Even for countries that may be less vulnerable, large
negative economic impacts in other regions will inevitably jeopardize their
security and well-being. For instance, the temperature extremes and other
changes in climate patterns associated with global average temperature
increases of 2 °C (3.6 °F) or more are projected to increase mortality rates
and reduce agricultural productivity in many regions, threaten the health
and sustainability of many ecosystems, and necessitate expensive measures
to adapt to these changes. Box 9-1 discusses recent research on projected
physical and economic impacts in the United States.
Some regions of the world are expected to be particularly hardhit. For example, low-lying and island countries are especially vulnerable
to sea-level rise. Further, developing countries, especially those outside
moderate temperature zones, may be especially poorly equipped to confront
temperature changes. Recent research, for example, suggests that India
may experience substantial declines in agricultural yields and increases in
mortality rates (Guiteras 2009; Burgess et al. 2009).
These projected changes are predicated on likely increases in global
mean temperature. Particularly worrisome is the possibility of much greater
temperature change, should more extreme projections prove accurate.
Although more drastic increases are less likely, their consequences could be
Transforming the Energy Sector and Addressing Climate Change  |  239

devastating. For example, the costs of climate change are expected to grow
nonlinearly (that is, more rapidly) as temperatures rise (Box 9-2).
In the United States, continued reliance on petroleum-based fuels
poses challenges that go beyond climate change. It makes the economy
susceptible to potentially costly spikes in crude oil prices and imposes
significant national security costs. A panel of retired senior military
officers and national security experts concluded that unabated climate
change may act as a “threat multiplier” to foment further instability in
some of the world’s most unstable regions (CNA Corporation 2007).
Fossil fuel consumption is also associated with other forms of pollution
that harm human health, such as particulate, sulfur dioxide, and mercury
emissions from coal-powered electricity generation.

Box 9-1: Climate Change in the United States and Potential Impacts
The average temperature in the United States has risen more than
1 °C (2 °F) over the past 50 years. However, this increase masks considerable regional variation. For instance, the temperature increase in Alaska
has been more than twice the U.S. average. By the end of the century, the
United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects that
average continental U.S. temperatures will increase by another 1.5 to 4.5
°C (about 2.7 to 8.1 °F) absent climate policy (Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change 2007). Greater increases are possible, depending
in part on how fast emissions rise over time. Climate change will likely
bring substantial changes to water resources, energy supply, transportation, agriculture, ecosystems, and public health. Potential effects on U.S.
water availability and agriculture are described below (Karl, Melillo, and
Peterson 2009).
Precipitation already has increased an average of 5 percent over the
past 50 years, with increases of up to 25 percent in parts of the Northeast
and Midwest and decreases of up to 20 percent in parts of the Southeast. In
the future, these trends will likely be amplified. The amount of rain falling
in the heaviest downpours has increased an average of 20 percent over the
past century, a trend that is expected to continue. In addition, Atlantic
hurricanes and the strongest cold-season storms in the North are likely
to become more powerful. In recent decades, the West has seen more
droughts, greater wildfire frequency, and a longer fire season. Increases
in temperature and reductions in rainfall frequency will likely exacerbate
future droughts and wildfires.

Box 9-1, continued
Although warmer temperatures may extend the growing season
in the United States for many crops, large increases in temperature also
may harm growth and yields. One study finds that yields are relatively
unaffected by changes in mean temperature, but that they are vulnerable to
an increase in the number of very hot days (Schlenker and Roberts 2009).
That said, another study finds that expected changes in temperature in the
United States will have a relatively small impact on overall agricultural
profits (Deschênes and Greenstone 2007). Neither study accounts for
the possible increase in yields from elevated carbon dioxide levels or the
possible decrease in yields from increased pests, weeds, and disease.
Climate change is also likely to bring increased weather uncertainty.
Extreme weather events—droughts and downpours—may have catastrophic effects on crops in some years. Growing crops in warmer climates
requires more water, which will be particularly challenging in regions such
as the Southeast that will likely face decreased water availability.
American farmers have substantial capacity for innovation and are
already taking steps to adapt to climate change. For instance, they are
changing planting dates and adopting crop varieties with greater resistance
to heat or drought. They can also undertake more elaborate change. In
areas projected to become hotter and drier, some farmers have returned to
dryland farming (instead of irrigation) to help the soil absorb more moisture from the rain. How well the private sector can adapt to the effects of
climate change and at what cost is still an open question.

Box 9-2: Expected Consumption Loss Associated with
Temperature Increase
One major uncertainty regarding climate change is the relationship
between temperature change and living standards, usually measured
as total consumption. The highly respected PAGE model produces an
estimate of this relationship (see Box 9-2 figure). Specifically, it reports
the expected decline in consumption as a fraction of GDP in the year
2100. The range of these estimates is represented by the dotted lines that
represent the 5th and 95th percentile of the damage estimates. The range
reflects uncertainty about the sensitivity of the climate system to increased
greenhouse gas concentrations, the probability of catastrophic events, and
several other factors.
Continued on next page

Transforming the Energy Sector and Addressing Climate Change  |  241

Box 9-2, continued
The figure reveals that the projected losses for the most likely
range of temperature changes are relatively modest. For example, at the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s most likely temperature
increase of 3 ⁰C for a doubling of CO2 concentration (concentrations in
2100 are likely to be higher), the projected decline is 1.5 percent of GDP.
The projected relationship between temperature changes and
consumption losses is nonlinear—that is, the projected losses grow more
rapidly as temperature increases. For example, while the projected loss for
the first 3 ⁰C is 1.5 percent, the loss at 6 ⁰C is five times higher. And the estimated loss associated with an increase of 9 ⁰C is about 20 percent with a 90
percent confidence interval of 8 to 38 percent. These large losses at higher
temperatures reflect the increased probability of especially harmful events,
such as large-scale changes in ice sheets or vegetation, or releases of methane
from thawing permafrost and warming oceans. Overall, it is evident that
policy based on the most likely outcomes may not adequately protect society
because such estimates fail to reflect the harms at higher temperatures.

Jump-Starting the Transition to Clean Energy
To make the transition to a clean energy economy, the United States
and the rest of the world need to reduce their reliance on carbon-intensive
fossil fuels. The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009 provides
a jump-start to this transition by providing about $60 billion in direct
spending and $30 billion in tax credits (Council of Economic Advisers 2010).
These Recovery Act investments were carefully chosen and provide a soupto-nuts approach across a spectrum of energy-related activities, ranging
from taking advantage of existing opportunities to improve energy efficiency
to investing in innovative high-technology solutions that are currently little
more than ideas. These investments will help create a new generation of
jobs, reduce dependence on oil, enhance national security, and protect the
world from the dangers of climate change. Ultimately, the investments will
put the United States on a path to becoming a global leader in clean energy.

Recovery Act Investments in Clean Energy
A market-based approach to reducing greenhouse gases (discussed
in detail later) will provide incentives for research and development (R&D)
into new clean energy technologies as firms search for ever cheaper ways to
address the negative externality associated with their emissions. However, as
already described, there is a separate externality in the area of R&D. Because
it is difficult for the person or firm doing research to capture all of the returns,
the private market supplies too little R&D—particularly for more basic forms
of R&D, less so as ideas move toward demonstration and deployment. In this
case, government R&D policies can complement the use of a market-based
approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and yield large benefits to
society. A policy that broadly incentivizes energy R&D is more likely to
maximize social returns than a narrow one targeted at a specific technology
because it allows the market, rather than the government, to pick winners.
Likewise, funding efforts in support of basic R&D are less likely to crowd out
private investment because differences between private and social returns to
innovation are largest for basic R&D.
In its 2011 proposed budget, the Administration has stated a commitment to fund R&D as part of its comprehensive approach to transform
the way we use and produce energy while addressing climate change. The
Recovery Act investments begun in 2009 are a first step in this clean energy
transformation. They fall into eight categories that are briefly described here.

Transforming the Energy Sector and Addressing Climate Change  |  243

Energy Efficiency. The Recovery Act promotes energy efficiency
through investments that reduce energy consumption in many sectors
of the economy. For instance, the Act appropriates $5 billion to the
Weatherization Assistance Program to pay up to $6,500 per dwelling unit
for energy efficiency retrofits in low-income homes. The Recovery Act also
appropriates $3.2 billion to the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block
Grant program, most of which will go to U.S. states, territories, local governments, and Indian tribes to fund projects that improve energy efficiency,
reduce energy use, and lower fossil fuel emissions.
Renewable Generation. The Recovery Act investments in renewable energy generation also are leading to the installation of wind turbines,
solar panels, and other renewable energy sources. The Energy Information
Administration projects that the fraction of the Nation’s electricity generated from renewable energy, excluding conventional hydroelectric power,
will grow from 3 percent in 2008 to almost 7 percent in 2012 in large part
because of the renewal of Federal tax credits and the funding of new loan
guarantees for renewable energy through the Recovery Act (Department of
Energy 2009a).
Grid Modernization. As the United States transitions to greater use of
intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, the Recovery
Act is financing the construction of new transmission lines that can support
electricity generated by renewable energy. The Act is also investing in new
technologies that will improve electricity storage capabilities and the monitoring of electricity use through “smart grid” devices, such as sophisticated
electric meters. These investments will improve the reliability, flexibility,
and efficiency of the Nation’s electricity grid.
Advanced Vehicles and Fuels Technologies. The Recovery Act is
funding research on and deployment of the next generation of automobile
batteries, advanced biofuels, plug-in hybrids, and all-electric vehicles, as well
as the necessary support infrastructure. These efforts are expected to reduce
the Nation’s dependence on oil in the transportation sector.
Traditional Transit and High-Speed Rail. Grants from the Recovery
Act also will help upgrade the reliability and service of public transit and
conventional intercity railroad systems. For example, $8 billion is going to
improve existing, or build new, high-speed rail in 100- to 600-mile intercity
corridors. Investments in high-speed rail and public transit will increase
energy efficiency by improving both access and reliability, thus making it
possible for more people to switch to rail or public transit from autos or
other less energy-efficient forms of transportation.
Carbon Capture and Storage. One approach to limiting greenhouse
gas emissions is to capture and store carbon from fossil-fuel combustion to
244  |  Chapter 9

keep it from entering the atmosphere. The abundance of coal reserves in the
United States makes developing such technologies and overcoming barriers
to their use a particular priority. For instance, technology to capture carbon
dioxide emissions has been used in industrial applications but has not been
used on a commercial scale to capture emissions from power generation.
Likewise, although some carbon has been stored deep in the ocean or underground in depleted oil reservoirs, questions remain about the permanence
of these and other types of storage. The Recovery Act is funding crucial
research, development, and demonstration of these technologies.
Innovation and Job Training. The Recovery Act is also investing
in the science and technology needed to build the foundation for the clean
energy economy. For instance, a total of $400 million has been allocated to
the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) program, which
funds creative new research ideas aimed at accelerating the pace of innovation in advanced energy technologies that would not be funded by industry
because of technical or financial uncertainty. The Recovery Act also helps
fund the training of workers for jobs in the energy efficiency and clean
energy industries of the future.
Clean Energy Equipment Manufacturing. The Recovery Act
investments are increasing the Nation’s capacity to manufacture wind
turbines, solar panels, electric vehicles, batteries, and other clean energy
components domestically. As the United States transitions away from fossil
fuels, demand for advanced energy products will grow, and these investments in clean energy will help American manufacturers participate in
supplying the needed goods.
Total Recovery Act Energy Investments. The Recovery Act is
investing in 56 projects and activities that are related to transitioning the
economy to clean energy. Forty-five are spending provisions with a total
appropriation of $60.7 billion, and another 11 are tax incentives that the
Office of Tax Analysis estimates will cost $29.5 billion through fiscal year
2019, for a total investment of over $90 billion. In some cases, a relatively
small amount of Federal investment leverages a larger amount of nonFederal support. Throughout this section, only the expected subsidy cost of
the Federal investment is counted toward the appropriation.3
The largest clean energy investments from the Recovery Act go to
renewable energy generation and transmission, energy efficiency, and
transit. Figure 9-2 illustrates how this $90 billion investment is distributed
across the eight categories of projects described above, along with a ninth
“other” category containing programs that do not fit elsewhere.

Because of the public nature of the Bonneville and Western Area Power Administrations, the
accounting of clean energy investments described here measures the projected drawdown of the
borrowing authority to these agencies as the Recovery Act appropriation.

Because most of the clean energy investments involve grants and
contracts that require that proposals be reviewed before funds are expended,
not all of the money appropriated for these investments could be spent
immediately. Thus, as with the Recovery Act more generally, only a portion
of the appropriation has been spent. Over $31 billion has been obligated and
over $5 billion has been outlayed through the end of 2009.4

Short-Run Macroeconomic Effects of the Clean Energy
Investments
Using a macroeconomic model, the Council of Economic Advisers
(CEA) estimates that the approximately $90 billion of Recovery Act investments will save or create about 720,000 job-years by the end of 2012 (a
job-year is one job for one year). Projects in the renewable energy generation and transmission, energy efficiency, and transit categories create
the most job-years. Approximately two-thirds of the job-years represent
work on clean energy projects, either by workers employed directly on the
projects or by workers at suppliers to the projects. These macroeconomic
benefits make it clear that the Administration has made a tremendous down
payment on the clean energy transformation.

Obligated means that the money is available to recipients once they make expenditures, and
outlayed means the government has reimbursed recipients for their expenditures. Energyrelated tax reductions to date are included in the totals obligated and outlayed by the end of 2009.

Other Domestic Actions to
Mitigate Climate Change
In his first year in office, the President took several other significant
and concrete steps to transform the energy sector and address climate
change. Significantly, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued
two findings in December 2009. The first finding was that six greenhouse
gases endanger public health and welfare. The second finding was that the
emissions of these greenhouse gases from motor vehicles cause or contribute
to pollution that threatens public health and welfare. These findings do not
in and of themselves trigger any requirements for emitters, but they lay the
foundation for regulating greenhouse gas emissions.
Following up on these findings, the Administration has proposed
the first mandatory greenhouse gas emission standards for new passenger
vehicles. The standards are expected to be finalized in the spring of 2010.
By model year 2016, new cars and light trucks sold in the United States will
be required to meet a fleet-wide tailpipe emissions limit equivalent to a
standard of about 35.5 miles per gallon if met entirely through fuel economy
improvements. The EPA estimates that these standards will save about
36 billion gallons of fuel and reduce vehicle greenhouse gas emissions by
about 760 million metric tons in CO2-equivalent terms over the lifetime of
the vehicles.
The Administration also proposed renewable fuel standards consistent with the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA), which requires
that a minimum volume of renewable fuel be added to gasoline sold in the
United States. Renewable fuels are derived from bio-based feedstocks such
as corn, soy, sugar cane, or cellulose that have fewer life-cycle greenhouse gas
emissions than the gasoline or diesel they replace. When fully implemented,
the standards will increase the volume of renewable fuel blended into
gasoline from 9 billion gallons in 2008 to 36 billion gallons by 2022.
The Administration also has been proactive in establishing minimum
energy efficiency standards for a wide variety of consumer products and
commercial equipment. For instance, standards were proposed or finalized
in 2009 for microwave ovens, dishwashers, small electric motors, lighting,
vending machines, residential water heaters, and commercial clothes
washers, among others. Overall, these actions will reduce energy consumption and, in turn, greenhouse gas emissions. The Energy Information
Administration’s 2009 Annual Energy Outlook projected that by 2030,
higher fuel economy and lighting efficiency standards will contribute to
lowering energy use per capita by 10 percent, compared with fairly stable
energy use per capita between 1980 and 2008 (Department of Energy
Transforming the Energy Sector and Addressing Climate Change  |  247

2009b). The 2010 Annual Energy Outlook highlights appliance and building
efficiency standards as one reason for lower projected carbon dioxide emissions growth, underscoring the benefits of these regulations (Department of
Energy 2009a).
Beginning in 2010, the United States will begin collecting
comprehensive high-quality data on greenhouse gases from large emitters
in many sectors of the economy (for instance, electricity generators and
cement producers). When fully implemented, this program will cover about
85 percent of U.S. emissions. The information supplied will provide a basis
for formulating policy on how best to reduce emissions in the future. It
will also be a valuable tool to allow industry to track emissions over time.
Specifically, these data will make it possible for industry and government to
identify the cheapest ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Finally, the President issued an Executive Order requiring Federal
agencies to set and meet aggressive goals for greenhouse gas emission reductions. Importantly, agencies are instructed to pursue reductions that lower
energy expenses and save taxpayers money.

Market-Based Approaches to Advance
the Clean Energy Transformation
and Address Climate Change
Greenhouse gas emissions, as noted, are a classic example of a
negative externality. Emitters of greenhouse gases contribute to climate
change, thus imposing a cost on others that is not accounted for when
making decisions about how to produce and consume energy-intensive
goods. For this reason, policymakers should ensure that the market provides
the correct signals to greenhouse-gas emitters about the full cost of their
emissions. Once policy has ensured that markets are providing the correct
signals and incentives, the operation of market forces can find the most
effective and efficient paths to the clean energy economy. The President
has included a market-based cap-and-trade approach in his 2010 and 2011
budgets as a way to accomplish this goal. This section describes the basics
of this approach, including several potential ways to minimize compliance
costs. It then discusses a specific proposal consistent with the President’s
goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Cap-and-Trade Program Basics
A cap-and-trade approach sets a limit on, or caps, total annual
aggregate greenhouse gas emissions and then divides the cap into

248  |  Chapter 9

emission allowances. These allowances are allocated to firms through
some combination of an auction and free allocation.5 Firms may trade the
allowances among themselves but are required to hold an allowance for each
ton of greenhouse gas they emit. The aggregate cap limits the number of
allowances available, ensuring their scarcity and thus establishing a price in
the market for allowances. In this way, a cap-and-trade approach provides
certainty in the quantity of emission reductions but allows the price of allowances to fluctuate with changes in the demand and supply.
Creating a market for greenhouse gas emissions gives firms flexibility
in how they reduce emissions. Absent other regulatory requirements, a
firm subject to the cap can choose to comply by changing its input mix (for
instance, switching from coal to natural gas), modifying the underlying
technology used in production (using more energy-efficient equipment,
for example), or purchasing allowances from other entities with lower
abatement costs. Such flexibility reaps rewards. A cap-and-trade program
induces firms to seek out and exploit the lowest-cost ways of cutting emissions. It takes advantage of the profit motive and leverages private sector
imagination and ingenuity to find ways to lower emissions.
Cap-and-trade programs already have proven successful. The United
States has been using a cap-and-trade approach to reduce sulfur dioxide
(SO2) emissions since 1995. One study found that using a cap-and-trade
approach instead of a performance standard to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions caused some firms to move away from putting scrubbers on their
smokestacks to cheaper ways of meeting the cap, such as by blending
different fuels (Burtraw and Palmer 2004). As a result, compliance costs of
the SO2 cap-and-trade program have been dramatically lower than predicted.
Finally, a cap-and-trade approach promotes innovation. A carbon
price will give firms the certainty they need to make riskier long-term investments that could identify novel and substantially cheaper ways to reduce
emissions. Evidence shows that pricing sulfur dioxide emissions through
a cap-and-trade approach has produced patentable innovations as firms
search for ever cheaper ways to abate (Burtraw and Szambelan 2009).
In the case of greenhouse gases, possible innovations range from new
techniques to capture and store carbon generated by coal-burning electricity
plants, to carbon-eating trees and algae, to the development of new types of
renewable fuels. Indeed, such innovation—and the opportunity it provides
5

In his fiscal year 2011 proposed budget, the President supports using allowance revenue to
compensate vulnerable families, communities, and businesses during the transition to the clean
energy economy, as well as in support of clean energy technologies and adapting to the impacts
of climate change.

to make the United States a world leader in clean energy technologies—is a
key motivation for the Administration’s energy and climate policies.

Ways to Contain Costs in an Effective Cap-and-Trade System
There are a wide variety of ways to contain costs within a cap-andtrade framework. For instance, cap-and-trade programs may incorporate
banking and borrowing of emission allowances over time, set ceilings or
floors on allowance prices, or permit the use of offsets as ways to smooth the
costs of compliance over time. A brief review of these mechanisms follows.
Banking and Borrowing. A cap-and-trade approach can be designed
to give polluters flexibility in the timing of emission reductions through
banking and borrowing. To limit allowance price volatility, sources can
make greater reductions early if it is cheaper to do so and bank their allowances for future use. Likewise, firms can manage costs by borrowing against
future reductions, allowing them to emit more today in return for more
drastic reductions later.
Evidence shows that banking has played a particularly powerful role
in helping firms to hedge uncertainty in the costs of the SO2 cap-and-trade
program over time. Anticipating that the cap originally set in 1995 would
become more stringent in 2000, firms began to bank allowances for future
use soon after the system was put in place. By 1999, almost 70 percent of
available allowances in the market had been banked. Once the more stringent cap was in place, the banked allowances were drawn down to meet
the cap, with about a 40 percent decrease in the size of the allowance bank
between 2000 and 2005 (Environmental Protection Agency 2006).
In contrast, the inability of firms to bank or borrow in Southern
California’s nitrous oxide market played a significant role in increased price
volatility during the State’s electricity crisis in 2000 when firms met soaring
demand for electricity by running old, dirty generators. One study found
that the absence of banking and borrowing was an important contributing factor to the roughly tenfold increase in the price of nitrous oxide
allowances, resulting in power plants subject to the cap eventually seeking
exemption from the program (Ellerman, Joskow, and Harrison 2003).
Price Ceilings or Floors. While banking and borrowing allow firms to
smooth costs over time, they may not guard against unexpected and potentially longer-lasting changes in allowance prices caused by such factors as a
recession or economic boom, fuel price fluctuations, or unexpected variation in the pace of technological development. Consequently, cap-and-trade
systems often include protections against prices that are deemed too high.
For example, in the Northeast’s greenhouse gas trading system, allowance

250  |  Chapter 9

prices above certain thresholds trigger additional flexibilities that reduce
compliance costs.6
Another way for a cap-and-trade program to mitigate the effects of
unexpected changes would be to specify an upper or lower limit, or both, on
allowance prices. An upper limit protects firms and consumers from unexpectedly high prices. When the price reaches the upper limit, additional
allowances are sold to prevent further escalation. A lower limit on allowance
prices ensures that cheap abatement opportunities continue to be pursued.
For example, cap-and-trade legislation recently passed by the U.S. House of
Representatives reserves a small share of allowances to be auctioned if the
price rises above a predetermined threshold and also sets a minimum price
for allowances that are auctioned. One study finds that, for a given cumulative emissions reduction, a combined price ceiling and floor can reduce costs
by almost 20 percent compared with a cap-and-trade program without any
cost-containment mechanisms (Fell and Morgenstern 2009). On the other
hand, it is possible that a floor or ceiling can cause total emissions to differ
from the legislated cap.
Offsets. Offsets also can be an important cost-containment feature
of a cap-and-trade program. Offsets are credits generated by reducing
emissions in a sector outside the program; they can be purchased by a firm
subject to the cap to meet its compliance obligations. Because greenhouse
gases are global pollutants—they cause the same damage no matter where
they are emitted—offsets offer the appealing prospect of achieving specified
emissions reductions at a lower cost.
The purchase of offsets from the forestry and agricultural sectors
could play a potentially important role in reducing the compliance costs of
firms subject to the cap (Kinderman et al. 2008; Environmental Protection
Agency 2009). And under some cap-and-trade programs, domestic firms
may purchase international offsets to meet their compliance obligations.
This possibility may encourage a foreign country to build a solar power plant
rather than a coal plant so that it can sell the offsets in the U.S. market.
Despite these important advantages, however, it is crucial that the
claimed reductions from offsets be real—otherwise the system will effectively provide payments without actually reducing emissions. Indeed,
Europe’s experience with a project-based approach to international offsets
suggests that concerns about the environmental integrity of claimed
6

Above $7 per ton (in 2005 dollars), a firm can cover up to 5 percent of its emissions with
domestic offsets, up from 3.3 percent. At $10 per ton (in 2005 dollars plus a 2 percent increase
per year), this amount increases to 10 percent of emissions and may include international offsets.

Transforming the Energy Sector and Addressing Climate Change  |  251

emissions reductions are well founded (Box 9-3).7 If offsets are going to
be included as part of a cap-and-trade program, substantial investments
in rigorous monitoring methods, such as combining remote sensing with
on-the-ground monitoring, to verify greenhouse gas reductions are crucial.

Box 9-3: The European Union’s Experience with Emissions Trading
One of the pillars of the President’s proposed response to climate
change is a cap-and-trade system to reduce U.S. emissions of greenhouse
gases. The European Union’s Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), the world’s
first mandatory cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide emissions, was
launched in 2005 to meet emission reduction targets agreed to under the
Kyoto Protocol. The first phase of the ETS—from 2005 to 2007—applied
to several high-emitting industrial sectors, including power generation, in
25 countries and covered just over 40 percent of all European Union (EU)
emissions. Although data limitations and uncertainty over baseline emissions preclude researchers from assessing the precise magnitude of the
reductions, one estimate suggests that the ETS reduced EU emissions by
about 4 percent in 2005 and 2006 relative to what the level would have been
in its absence. Because of the flexibility offered under the cap-and-trade
program, these reductions occurred where it was cheapest to achieve them.
That said, the ETS offers three important cautionary lessons as the United
States explores how best to implement its own cap-and-trade system.
One lesson is the importance of carefully establishing a baseline for
current and future emissions, so that the price sends an accurate signal to
firms regarding how much to abate and innovate based on the expected
future value of reductions. During the first phase of the ETS, EU countries
allocated allowances based on firms’ estimates of their historic emissions.
In April 2006, when monitoring data became available, the data showed
that actual emissions were already below the cap. Allowance prices immediately fell from about €30 ($38) per metric ton to less than €10 ($13)
before settling at €15−€20 ($19−$25) for the next few months.
The EU experience also demonstrates that distributing nearly all
allowances to industry at no cost can lead to large windfall profits. The
European Union distributed nearly 100 percent of allowances free to
Continued on next page

Cap-and-trade programs that allow project-level offsets are particularly susceptible to crediting
activity that would have occurred anyway or that is replaced by high-carbon activities elsewhere
(leakage). One way to reduce the potential for leakage is a sector- or country-based framework,
in which sectors or governments receive credit in exchange for implementing policies to reduce
emissions. The legislation passed by the U.S. House of Representatives includes a sector-based
approach to international offsets.

252  |  Chapter 9

Box 9-3, continued
firms subject to the cap in Phase 1 and only auctioned a small portion of
allowances for Phase 2 (2008−12). One estimate (Point Carbon Advisory
Services 2008) suggests that during Phase 2, electricity generators in
Germany will reap the highest windfall profits of all participating EU
countries, on the order of €14 billion to €34 billion ($20 billion to
$49 billion). In countries with low-greenhouse-gas emitters, electricity
generators are expected to benefit less. For instance, in Spain, windfall
profits are estimated to be about €1 billion to €4 billion ($1 billion to
$6 billion). In Phase 3 (2013–20), the European Union plans to auction
the majority of allowances.
Finally, it is important to ensure that any offsets from domestic
and international sources reflect real reductions. Otherwise, they may
endanger the environmental integrity of the cap. The ETS allows limited
use of project-based international offsets from the United Nations’ Clean
Development Mechanism (CDM) in place of domestic emission reductions. A review of a random sample of offset project proposals in the CDM
program from 2004 to 2007 estimated that “additionality” was unlikely or
questionable for roughly 40 percent of registered projects, representing
20 percent of emissions reductions, meaning they would have occurred
anyway (Schneider 2007). Although the CDM has worked to improve its
accounting procedures over time, the EU’s experience demonstrates the
importance of designing an offsets program carefully.

Coverage of Gases and Industries
Although carbon dioxide made up about 83 percent of U.S.
greenhouse emissions in 2008, a cap-and-trade approach that gives firms
flexibility in where they reduce emissions, both in terms of the greenhouse
gas and the economic sector, can lower firms’ compliance costs. One study
found that achieving an emission goal by cutting both methane and carbon
dioxide emissions rather than carbon dioxide alone could reduce firms’
abatement costs in the United States by over 25 percent in the medium run
(Hayhoe et al. 1999).
Costs are also affected by the number of industries covered by the cap,
with the general principle being that greater coverage lowers the marginal
cost of emissions reductions. A recent study comparing alternative ways
to achieve a 5 percent reduction in emissions found that the cap-and-trade
program’s costs to the economy were twice as large when manufacturing was
excluded as they were under an economy-wide approach (Pizer et al. 2006).

The American Clean Energy and Security Act
In June 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation—the
American Clean Energy and Security Act (ACES)—that includes a cap-andtrade program consistent with the President’s goal of reducing greenhouse
gas emissions by more than 80 percent by 2050, and the Senate is currently
engaged in a bipartisan effort to develop a bill.
Projected Climate Benefits. Based on two analyses of the ACES
legislation, U.S. actions would reduce cumulative greenhouse gas emissions
by approximately 110 billion to 150 billion metric tons in CO2-equivalents
by 2050 (Paltsev et al. 2009; Environmental Protection Agency 2009). The
EPA estimates that emission reductions of this magnitude, when combined
with comparable action by other countries consistent with reducing world
emissions by 50 percent in 2050, is expected to limit warming in 2100 to less
than 2 °C (3.6 °F) relative to the pre-industrial global average temperature,
with a likely range of about 1.0 to 2.5 °C (1.8 to 4.5 °F).
To derive the possible benefits associated with the U.S. contribution
to these emission reductions, the CEA calculates that the ACES will result in
approximately $1.6 trillion to $2.0 trillion of avoided global damages in present
value terms between 2012 and 2050 (in 2005 dollars).8 The value of avoided
damages includes such benefits as lower mortality rates, higher agricultural
yields, money saved on adaptation measures, and the reduced likelihood of
small-probability but high-impact catastrophic events. Further, the benefits
will be significantly larger if U.S. policy induces other countries to undertake
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
Projected Economic Costs. The estimated cost of meeting the caps
outlined in the ACES legislation is relatively small. Recent research suggests
that the ACES will result in a loss of consumption on the order of 1 to
2 percent in 2050 (Environmental Protection Agency 2009; Paltsev et
al. 2009). On a per household basis, the average annual consumption
loss would be between $80 and $400 a year between 2012 and 2050 (in
2005 dollars).

The CEA uses estimates of the projected decline in emissions between 2012 and 2050 based on
the President’s proposed reductions in emissions and uses the central estimate of $20 a ton for a
unit of carbon dioxide emitted in 2007 (in 2007 dollars) that was recently developed as an interim
value for regulatory analyses (Department of Energy 2009c). Additionally, it assumes that the
benefit of reducing one additional ton of carbon dioxide grows at 3 percent over time and that
future damages from current emissions are discounted using an average of 5 percent. Several
Federal agencies have used these values in recent proposed rulemakings but have requested
comment prior to the final rulemaking, so these estimates may be revised.

International Action on Climate Change
Is Needed
Greenhouse gas emissions impose global risks. As a result, just as
U.S. efforts to reduce emissions benefit other countries, actions that other
countries take to mitigate emissions benefit the United States. Given the
global nature of the problem and the declining U.S. share of greenhouse gas
emissions, U.S. actions alone to reduce those emissions are insufficient to
mitigate the most serious risks from climate change.
Developing countries such as China and India are responsible for a
growing proportion of emissions because of their heavy reliance on carbonintensive fuels, such as coal (Figure 9-3). In 1992, China’s carbon dioxide
emissions from fossil fuel combustion were half those of the United States
and represented 12 percent of global emissions. By 2008, China’s carbon
dioxide emissions represented 22 percent of global emissions from fossil
fuels, exceeding the U.S. share of 19 percent and the European share of
15 percent. China’s share of global emissions is projected to grow to about
29 percent by 2030 absent new emission mitigation policies. By contrast, the
U.S. share of global emissions is projected to fall to about 15 percent by 2030
even absent new emission mitigation policy. Thus, cooperation by both

past and future contributors to emissions will be required to stabilize the
atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.
In keeping with this goal, the Administration has actively pursued
partnerships with major developed and emerging economies to advance
efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote economic
development that lowers emission intensity.

Partnerships with Major Developed and Emerging Economies
The President has worked to further a series of international
agreements to address climate change. For example, he launched the Major
Economies Forum on Energy and Climate to engage 17 developed and
emerging economies in a dialogue on climate change. In July, the leaders of
these countries agreed that greenhouse gas emissions should peak in developed and developing countries alike, and recognized the scientific view that
the increase in global average temperature above pre-industrial levels ought
not to exceed 2 °C (3.6 °F). They also agreed to coordinate and dramatically increase investment in research, development, and deployment of
low-carbon energy technologies with a goal of doubling such investment by
2015. Finally, the leaders agreed to mobilize financial resources in support
of mitigation and adaptation activities, recognizing that the group should be
responsive to developing-country needs in this area.
Also in July, leaders from the Group of Eight (G-8) countries agreed
to undertake robust aggregate and individual medium-term emission reductions consistent with the objective of cutting global emissions by at least
50 percent by 2050. Additionally, under the Montreal Protocol, the United
States jointly proposed with Canada and Mexico to phase down emissions
of hydrofluorocarbons, a potent greenhouse gas used in refrigeration, fire
suppression, and other industrial activities. This action alone would achieve
about 10 percent of the greenhouse gas emission reductions needed to meet
the agreed G-8 goal of a 50 percent reduction by 2050.
In December, the Administration worked with major emerging
economies, including Brazil, China, India, and South Africa, developed
countries, and other regions around the world to secure agreement on
the Copenhagen Accord. For the first time, the international community
established a long-term goal to limit warming of global average temperature
to no more than 2 °C (3.6 °F). Also for the first time, all major economies
agreed to take action to address climate change. Under the Accord, both
developed and major emerging economies are in the process of submitting
their emission mitigation commitments and actions to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions. Every two years, developing countries will report on emission
mitigation efforts, which will be subject to international consultation and
256  |  Chapter 9

analysis under clearly defined guidelines. Establishing transparent review of
developed and developing country mitigation activities will help ensure that
countries stand behind their commitments.
Furthermore, under the Accord, in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency, developed countries committed to a goal of
jointly mobilizing $100 billion a year in funding from a variety of private and
public sources for developing countries by 2020. This funding will build on
an immediate effort by developed countries to support forestry, adaptation,
and emissions mitigation with funding approaching $30 billion sometime in
the 2010 to 2012 timeframe. There will be a special focus on directing this
funding to the poorest and most vulnerable developing countries.

Phasing Out Fossil Fuel Subsidies
The United States also spearheaded an agreement in September to
phase out fossil fuel subsidies among G-20 countries, a goal seconded by
countries in the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in November.
The G-20 also called on all nations to phase out such subsidies worldwide. Fossil fuel subsidies are particularly large in non-OECD countries,
such as India and Russia. Twenty of the largest non-OECD governments
spent about $300 billion on fossil fuel subsidies in 2007. Together, this
coordinated action to reduce subsidies can free up resources, especially in
developing countries, to target other social needs such as public health and
education. One model estimates that eliminating fossil fuel subsidies in
the major non-OECD countries alone would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 7 billion metric tons of CO2-equivalent, enough to fulfill
almost 15 percent of the agreed-upon G-8 goal of reducing global emissions by 50 percent by 2050 (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development 2009).
In the United States, these subsidies—including tax credits,
deductions, expensing practices, and exemptions—are worth about
$44 billion in tax revenues between 2010 and 2019. Their elimination will
help put cleaner fuels, such as those derived from renewable sources, on a
more equal footing and reduce wasteful consumption of fossil-fuel based
energy caused by underpricing. Proper pricing of fossil fuels will also help
reduce reliance on petroleum, thus enhancing energy security and aiding in
the achievement of climate mitigation goals.

Conclusion
Today’s economy is dependent on carbon-intensive fuels that are
directly linked to an increase in global average temperature. Continued
Transforming the Energy Sector and Addressing Climate Change  |  257

reliance on these fuels will have a range of negative impacts, including
increased mortality rates, reduced agricultural productivity in many locations, higher sea levels, and the need for costly adaptation efforts. For these
reasons, a clean energy transformation is essential.
Through his comprehensive plan, the President has set the country
on course to achieve this goal. He has taken several significant and concrete
steps to transform the energy sector and address climate change through
the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act and through targeted regulation. To address externalities associated with greenhouse gas emissions,
the President has proposed a market-based cap-and-trade approach. These
combined efforts will stimulate the research and development necessary to
advance new clean energy technologies. Because of the global nature of the
climate change problem, the Administration is also actively pursuing partnerships with other countries to advance efforts to transition the world to
clean energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

A

mericans have always believed in building a better future. Each
generation has strived to pass on higher standards of living to their
children than they themselves experienced. And for most of American
history, this goal has been realized. Per capita income has risen strongly for
most of the past two centuries.
Such economic growth stems from a number of factors. Investment
in skills and education, or human capital, is a key determinant. The United
States has a long history of investing in people, and this has enabled American
workers to be among the most productive in the world. Investment in physical capital is also important. The tremendous accumulation of machines,
buildings, and infrastructure has been a source of America’s prosperity, and
times of particularly great investment, such as the 1950s and 1960s, have
been times of particularly rapid advances in standards of living.
Because investing in people and capital is important to the
maintenance and growth of standards of living, the President has fashioned
an ambitious agenda of improvements in education, incentives for investment, and financial regulatory reform to ensure that we have the financial
system needed to support such investment. These initiatives have been
described in detail in earlier chapters.
But as important as investments in labor and capital have been and
will continue to be, they are not the only sources of growth. A third, more
amorphous factor has also played a central role in American economic
growth: advances in the overall productivity of that labor and capital. One
need only think of a few of the technological changes of the past century—
the airplane, antibiotics, computers, fiber-optic cables, and the Internet—to
see that technological discovery and innovation are central to improved
standards of living. Such innovations not only make us richer as a country,
they have the potential to fundamentally alter the very way we live our lives
and interact with one another.
259

As discussed throughout this Report, in the past decade American
economic growth has slowed in important ways. American families saw
their median income actually fall from 2000 to 2006. An important part of
restoring growth and increases in standards of living is spurring innovation
and increases in productivity. American firms and universities will naturally
play the leading role in this endeavor. But that does not mean government
has no role to play. Indeed, overwhelming evidence shows that innovation
creates positive “externalities”—benefits for others beyond the individuals or
firms who originally produce new ideas. Since inventors do not reap the full
rewards, on its own the market will produce less innovation than is optimal.
Public policy therefore has a powerful role to play in fostering pursuit of the
myriad possibilities for scientific, technical, and analytical advances.
At its best, trade between regions of the country and across borders
can also be an engine of growth. Trade has the potential to allow the U.S.
economy to expand output in areas where it is more productive and to
enable higher-productivity firms to expand. Access to a world market
encourages American firms to invest in the research needed to become technological leaders. Through these routes, a free and fair trade regime can play
an important part in lifting living standards in the long run.
Based on an understanding that progress springs from achieving the
proper balance between generous rewards for the creation of new ideas and
encouraging the best of those ideas to spread widely, the Administration
has formulated a comprehensive “innovation agenda” that reaches far
beyond the traditional scope of science and technology policy. This agenda
touches everything from improvements in the Patent and Trademark
Office, to increased government investments in research and development
(R&D), to engaging the world economy in ways that ensure that the United
States achieves the maximum benefits from trade’s productivity-enhancing
potential. This chapter discusses the key components of the agenda in detail.
All advances in productivity, whether from scientific breakthroughs,
changes in the organization of firms, or increased international trade,
involve losers as well as winners. Because productivity growth is the critical
source of improved standards of living, the most effective way to address
the painful impacts for those harmed by progress is not to stifle new ideas
or trade. Rather, it is to build a robust system of support that can help ease
the transition from employment in declining firms and industries to jobs in
new, higher-paying, higher-productivity areas. Even more important are
broad-based policies that ensure that the gains from rising productivity are
widely shared: progressive taxation, a health care system that provides security and stability, a strong educational system, and a secure social safety net.

260  |  Chapter 10

For too many years, our Nation has ignored necessary reforms in
these broad-based policies and underinvested in areas such as health care
and education, which are essential to ensuring that middle-class families will
benefit from productivity advances. That is why the Obama Administration
has set as a central economic priority rebuilding our economy on a firmer
foundation. The Administration’s innovation agenda must go hand in hand
with progress in those areas as well.

The Role of Productivity Growth in
Driving Living Standards
In the long run, the critical determinant of living standards is labor
productivity—the amount of goods and services produced by an average
worker in a fixed period of time, such as an hour or a 40-hour week. Figure
10-1 provides striking visual confirmation of this hypothesis. It shows that
over U.S. history since the early 20th century, sustained increases in labor
productivity have translated nearly one-for-one into increases in income
per person.

Fostering Productivity Growth Through Innovation and Trade  |  261

The importance of labor productivity to living standards may seem
obvious, or even tautological, but it is not. In principle, increases in income
per person could come not from more output per unit of labor input, but
from more labor input per person—that is, from increases in the fraction of
the population that is working or increases in each worker’s hours. But both
the historical evidence from the United States and the evidence from across
a wide range of countries show that differences in labor input per person
account for at most a small fraction of income differences.

Recent Trends in Productivity in the United States
Since labor productivity is the key driver of standards of living in the
long run, it is important to discern the underlying trends in productivity.
This task is complicated by the fact that in the short run, productivity
depends on more than those underlying trends. It is powerfully influenced
by the state of the business cycle, as well as by other factors (including simple
measurement error) that leave no lasting mark on productivity.
Figure 10-2 shows the growth rate of labor productivity from
four quarters earlier over the last 62 years. One immediate message is
that although the overall pattern of productivity is strongly upward (as
shown clearly by Figure 10-1), there is enormous short-run variation in
productivity growth.

A more subtle message is that the average or trend rate of productivity
growth is not constant but changes substantially over extended periods. It is
conventional to divide the era from the beginning of the sample until about
1995 into two periods: the “immediate postwar” period from 1947 through
1972, and the “productivity growth slowdown” period from 1973 through
1995. In the immediate postwar period, the average rate of productivity
growth was 2.8 percent per year. During the productivity growth slowdown,
it was only 1.4 percent.
This division into different periods lets one see the cumulative
importance of even seemingly modest changes in productivity growth. For
example, if the high productivity growth of the immediate postwar period
had continued through 1995 instead of slowing, the level of productivity in
1995—and hence standards of living—would have been more than one-third
higher than they actually were.
The pattern of productivity growth since 1995 is somewhat
complicated. From 1996:Q1 to the last available observation (2009:Q3), it
averaged 2.7 percent per year, almost equal to its rate over the immediate
postwar period. But that rapid growth was concentrated in the first part
of the period. In the first eight years (1996:Q1 to 2003:Q4), productivity
growth averaged 3.3 percent; in the four years before the business cycle peak
(2004:Q1 to 2007:Q4), it averaged only 1.7 percent. A four-year period is too
short to confidently determine underlying trends. But productivity growth
in the years leading up to the recession was not strong enough to generate
robust increases in standards of living.
A final pattern revealed by Figure 10-2 is a relationship between
productivity growth and the business cycle. Productivity growth tends to fall
during recessions and surge near their ends (marked by the vertical lines in
Figure 10-2). This pattern has been operating strongly in the current recession. Productivity growth averaged less than 1 percent at an annual rate
over the first five quarters of the recession, but then surged in 2009:Q2 and
2009:Q3, and appears to have remained high in 2009:Q4.
This recent experience highlights the importance of distinguishing
between cyclical movements in productivity and longer-term movements:
the pattern in productivity growth in 2009 largely reflects the fact that
employment moves more slowly than production over the business cycle.
The sluggishness of employment growth has meant that even as output
reached its low point and began to recover, employment continued to
decline. This cyclical improvement in productivity is obviously of a different
character than the secular improvements that are the source of long-run
increases in standards of living. Over the course of 2009, standards of living
clearly did not follow productivity closely. But once the cyclical dynamics

play themselves out, the usual long-term role of productivity growth in
driving income growth is bound to reassert itself. An important goal of
policy is to make the long-term path of productivity as favorable as possible.

Sources of Productivity Growth
Productivity growth is the overwhelming determinant of the progress
of economic well-being over extended periods. It is therefore imperative to
understand what determines productivity growth. Three sources have been
identified as key.
The first source is the accumulation of physical capital—the machines,
tools, computers, factories, infrastructure, and so on that workers use to
produce output. Each year, some of our Nation’s economic output takes the
form of these capital goods. When workers have more or better capital to
work with, they are more productive.
The second source is the accumulation of human capital—workers’
education, skills, and training. The accumulation of human capital is just
as much an investment as the accumulation of physical capital is. When
some of the economy’s output takes the form of physical capital goods rather
than consumption, we are forgoing some consumption today in exchange
for the ability to produce more in the future. Likewise, when students and
teachers are in a classroom, or when an experienced worker is taking time to
train a new hire, resources that could be used to produce goods for current
consumption are being used instead for activities that increase future
productive capacity. And just as a worker with better equipment is more
productive, so too is a worker with more skills.
The third source of productivity growth is increases in the amount
that can be produced from given amounts of physical and human capital.
This factor goes by various names, such as “total factor productivity growth”
or “the Solow residual.” It encompasses all the forces that cause changes
in how much an economy produces from its stocks of physical and human
capital. Most obviously, it encompasses advances in knowledge and technology. These advances in knowledge and technology allow factory workers
to build better automobiles and electronics from the same raw materials;
they allow doctors to provide more accurate diagnoses and prescribe better
treatments in the same office visit; and much more.
But total factor productivity growth includes more than advances in
knowledge and technology. For example, if an economy faces an increase
in crime, individuals may devote more of their skills and physical capital
to protecting the goods they have rather than producing more goods,
and so total factor productivity growth may be low or even negative. If a
country switches from central planning to a market-based economy, then
264  |  Chapter 10

workers and capital are likely to be allocated more effectively, and so output
given the economy’s stocks of physical and human capital may increase
greatly. Changes in these types of “organizational capital” (or “institutional” or “social” capital) are potentially critical determinants of total factor
productivity growth.
Research has not just identified changes in these three factors
(physical capital, human capital, and total factor productivity) as critical
determinants of productivity growth; it has also come to a fairly clear view
about their relative importance. Perhaps surprisingly, the ranking of the
three factors appears to be the same whether one is trying to understand the
enormous growth in productivity over extended periods in the United States
(for example, Jones 2002), or the vast differences in the level of productivity
across countries (for example, Hall and Jones 1999).1
The factor that is most obvious and easiest to quantify—
physical capital accumulation—turns out to be only moderately important.
Differences in the fraction of output devoted to physical capital investment
account for some portion of both long-run productivity growth and crosscountry productivity differences, and increases in investment can have a
significant impact on productivity growth, and hence on standards of living.
At the same time, the evidence suggests that the other factors are even
more important.2
One of those more important factors is human capital accumulation.
Increases in the education and skills of the workforce play a substantial role
in the long-term growth of labor productivity, and cross-country differences
in human capital per worker are important to cross-country differences in
labor productivity. Thus, increases in human capital investment through a
stronger educational system and greater educational attainment at all levels,
together with lifetime learning, provide another powerful route to raising
productivity growth and standards of living.
The most important determinant is not physical or human capital
accumulation, but changes in how much can be produced with them—that
is, total factor productivity growth. Again, this finding applies to both longterm growth and cross-country differences. At an intuitive level, this result
is not surprising. It seems very plausible that the most important reason we
are so much more productive than our forebears is that, for reasons ranging
1

Klenow 2007.
2
There is a subtlety here. When total factor productivity or human capital improves, the result
is higher output, which then leads to more physical capital investment if the fraction of the economy’s output that is invested does not change. The decompositions that find a moderate role
for physical capital assign these indirect effects of total factor productivity and human capital
investment to those factors, and not to physical capital. If those effects are instead assigned to
physical capital, its importance increases greatly.

from advances in basic scientific knowledge to improved ways of organizing
the workplace, we have found vastly better ways of producing output from a
given set of inputs. Likewise, it is likely that a key reason the United States
outperformed the Soviet Union economically in the postwar period was
not that the United States was better at channeling its productive capacity
into producing capital goods and its children into education (both of which
the Soviet Union did on a very large scale), but that the United States’ freemarket institutions led it to produce more from its inputs, and led to myriad
innovations that widened the productivity gap over time.
This discussion implies that in order to foster improvements in
standards of living, policy should foster investment in physical capital,
investment in human capital, and crucially, improvements in total factor
productivity. Physical and human capital investment are discussed in
earlier chapters—most notably Chapter 4 (as well as Chapters 5 and 6) in
the case of physical capital investment, and Chapter 8 in the case of human
capital. The remainder of this chapter turns to measures to improve total
factor productivity. Such improvements in total factor productivity can be
described broadly as “innovations.”

Fostering Productivity Growth
Through Innovation
Because total factor productivity reflects all determinants of labor
productivity other than physical and human capital, it has a wide range of
elements. As a result, there are many avenues along which well-designed
policies can work to improve total factor productivity. It is for this reason
that the Administration has proposed a comprehensive innovation agenda
(Box 10-1).
Box 10-1: Overview of the Administration’s Innovation Agenda
On a September 21 visit to New York’s Hudson Valley Community
College, President Obama presented the first comprehensive description
of the Administration’s Innovation Agenda, the conceptual framework
underpinning the wide range of initiatives that the Administration has
undertaken that share a common aim of fostering innovation.
The Agenda has three elements. The first is a commitment to invest
in the building blocks of innovation, including basic scientific research
and infrastructure, as articulated in detail in the body of this chapter.
Continued on next page

266  |  Chapter 10

Box 10-1, continued
The second is a recognition of the vital role that competitive markets and
a healthy environment for entrepreneurial risk-taking play in spurring
innovation; reform of the Patent Office, improving the accessibility and
usefulness of government statistics, and increasing the predictability and
transparency of government policy are all parts of this effort. The final
part of the agenda is a particular focus on innovation targeted toward
specific national priorities, including the development of alternative
energy sources, reducing costs and improving medical care through the
use of health information technology, the creation of a “smart grid” that
will allow more efficient use of existing energy generation capacity, and
initiatives aimed at inventing cleaner and more fuel-efficient transportation technologies.
The Agenda builds on over $100 billion of funds appropriated in
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 for the support of
innovation, education, and technological and scientific infrastructure. It
also encompasses directives to regulatory and executive branch agencies
designed to help them refocus their missions to support the Agenda in
whatever ways are most appropriate to their usual activities. A final key
tool is the commitment to science-based, data-driven policymaking that
brings to bear all the intellectual, statistical, informational, and analytical
resources necessary to make sure that government policies achieve their
stated aims as efficiently and effectively as possible.

The Importance of Basic Research
One uncontroversial conclusion of work on the determinants of
productivity growth is that the payoff to investment in basic scientific and
technological research has been vast, at least in some fields and over the
long run. Breakthroughs on fundamental questions of physics, chemistry,
biology, and other sciences have powered the transformations of economic
production that underlie much of the productivity growth measured
(however imperfectly) in economic statistics (Nordhaus 1997; Nelson and
Romer 1996).
The Administration has taken that lesson to heart in its support for
basic research in science and technology, especially in two areas where
the need for progress is pressing: energy and biomedical research. The
Department of Energy has created a new Advanced Research Projects
Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), with the objective of pursuing breakthroughs

Fostering Productivity Growth Through Innovation and Trade  |  267

that could fundamentally change the way we use and produce energy. In
the medical and biological sciences, the Administration has ended restrictions on Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research, and in September
2009 it announced $5 billion in grants under the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act to fund cutting-edge medical research.
Across all areas, the Recovery Act included $18.3 billion for research
funding. Because the Administration’s commitment to evidence-based
policymaking will require substantial improvements in the ability to reliably measure economic outcomes, the Act committed $1 billion to the 2010
Census as a first step in a longer-term effort to revamp the Nation’s statistical infrastructure—a process that will not only improve policymaking but
will also help private businesses make better decisions (for example, about
where to locate new production or sales facilities).
In addition, the fiscal year 2011 budget enhances research funding
in numerous ways. First, it continues to work to fulfill the President’s
pledge to double the budgets of three key science agencies (the National
Science Foundation, the Department of Energy’s Office of Science, and
the Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and
Technology). Second, it boosts funding for biomedical research at the
National Institutes of Health by $1 billion to $32.1 billion. Third, it reinvigorates climate change research through increased investments in earth
observations and climate science in agencies such as the U.S. Geological
Survey and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Fourth,
it funds potentially groundbreaking discoveries with a boost to Department
of Defense basic research and $300 million for the Department of Energy’s
ARPA-E program. Finally, it supports world-class agricultural research for
national needs such as food safety and bioenergy with $429 million for the
competitive research grants program in the Department of Agriculture’s
new National Institute of Food and Agriculture.
As part of the innovation agenda, and to ensure that the increased
research funds are spent well, the Administration has also instructed agencies to work on constructing a set of systematic tools to track the long-term
results of federally sponsored research, such as journal articles published
and cited, patents obtained, medical advances achieved, or other measurable
consequences (particularly in areas of national importance such as health or
energy). Although the fruits of this effort will not be available for a number
of years, the project is one of the most promising in the Administration’s
efforts at turning the evaluation of scientific research into a “science
of science.”

268  |  Chapter 10

Private Research and Experimentation
Scientific breakthroughs are only the first step in producing
improvements in total factor productivity and hence living standards.
Benjamin Franklin’s discovery that lightning was a form of electricity did not
produce an immediate reduction in damage from electrical storms; much
further research and development was necessary to turn that discovery into
the lightning rod (though by late in his life Franklin was able to observe a
flourishing industry that had been built upon his insight).
Measuring the returns to the economy as a whole from private research
and experimentation is almost as formidable a challenge as measuring the
returns to basic research. But most studies find that aggregate returns to
such spending are much higher than the returns to ordinary investments in
physical capital. Some work estimates the aggregate returns at 50 percent or
higher (Hall, Mairesse, and Mohnen 2009).
These returns are mostly not received by the firms or individuals who
pay for the work, because the ideas ultimately benefit others in many ways
whose value is not captured through markets. Economic theory provides a
clear prescription for policy toward activities that have measurable positive
externalities: the activities should be subsidized.
This is the logic behind the research and experimentation (R&E) tax
credit that has been an off-and-on part of the tax code for many years. But
the credit’s effectiveness has been hampered by chronic uncertainty about
how long it will remain in force. Partly for budgetary accounting reasons,
the R&E tax credit has been treated for many years as a temporary provision that was scheduled to expire at some point in the near future. Yet each
year (except for 1995), Congress and the President have agreed (sometimes
at the last minute) to extend the credit. The effect has been to substantially
increase the uncertainty that firms face about the costs that they will end up
paying for their research and experimentation projects; this uncertainty can
have a serious negative effect on research, which is already a highly uncertain investment. The problem is particularly acute for the kinds of projects
that might be expected to have the highest returns: long-term projects that
require continuing expenditures over many years. For such projects, uncertainty about whether the R&E tax credit will be in place through the duration
of the project can make the difference between pursuing or abandoning
the research. The Administration therefore supports efforts in Congress
to make the R&E tax credit permanent, so that the highest-return long-run
projects can be confidently started without uncertainty about whether the
credit will be there for the duration.

The importance of both public and private R&D spending for
innovation and improvements in standards of living forms the basis for a
key Administration goal. In a speech in May 2009 to the National Academy
of Sciences, the President articulated the ambition of boosting total national
investment in research and development to 3 percent of gross domestic
product. As can be seen from Figure 10-3, this is a rate that would exceed
even the peak rates reached in the 1960s. As described earlier, the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act began the Federal contribution with a
historic increase in direct funding for scientific and technological research,
as well as major investments in technological and scientific infrastructure
detailed below. But reaching the President’s goal will require not just an
increase in the Federal Government’s role; equally important is the need for
a resurgence of entrepreneurial and corporate investment in research. The
Administration’s consequent focus on creating the best possible environment for private sector innovation is one of the many novel aspects of its
innovation agenda.

Protection of Intellectual Property Rights
A subsidy like the R&E credit is one way to address underinvestment
caused by the fact that the inventor of a new technology does not reap all the
benefits of that invention. An older approach is embodied in the American
270  |  Chapter 10

system of patents and copyrights that had its origins in the Constitution (and
before that, in the English legal system).
One leading scholar (Jones 2001) has argued that the invention of
ways to protect intellectual property may have been a trigger for the industrial revolution that led to the modern era of economic growth. In this
interpretation of history, the creation of a legal system that could protect
intellectual property may have been one of the most important “technological” developments in human history. Though this interpretation can
be debated, the practical implication is surely correct: achieving the proper
balance between the private and the societal rewards from innovation is a
critical element in creating and sustaining long-run economic growth.
The existing U.S. patent system developed over many years in response
to the needs of an industrial economy. That system has been under considerable strain in the past couple of decades as the United States and the world
have moved increasingly toward a “knowledge-based” economy. The Patent
and Trademark Office (PTO) has been required to answer many questions
that could not have been imagined in 1952 when the current patent statute
was written, such as how and whether to grant patents for human genes or for
Internet advertising tools. Further, the sheer volume of information necessary
to evaluate a patent application, which might now arrive from any country in
the world and might rely on ideas that even an expert might be unfamiliar with,
has made the PTO’s job increasingly daunting. As a result of these challenges,
the agency currently faces a backlog of over 700,000 unexamined applications.
Waiting times on a patent application can extend to four years or more. The
costs that such waiting times impose on firms are substantial; and delays impose
a particularly large burden on startup firms that rely on patents to attract venture
capital funding—precisely the kind of firms that the Administration’s innovation
agenda is particularly designed to help.
While the PTO has made progress in responding to these problems,
most notably by developing a “peer review” system modeled on academic
publishing, observers agree that the patent system is in need of an overhaul.
The Administration has endorsed the aims of bills pending in Congress
that would address many of these problems, particularly by giving the PTO
authority to set fees that cover the cost of application processing, and also by
barring diversion of fees to projects unrelated to PTO activities. The PTO is
also in the process of creating an Office of the Chief Economist, which will
provide a mechanism for better integration into patent policy of economic
research on how to properly reward innovation without stifling the
widespread use of good ideas.
In recognition of the role of innovation and intellectual property
in advancing continued U.S. leadership in the global economy, in 2008
Fostering Productivity Growth Through Innovation and Trade  |  271

Congress created the Office of the United States Intellectual Property
Enforcement Coordinator. This office is charged with creating and implementing a strategy to coordinate and enhance enforcement of intellectual
property rights in the United States and overseas. By ensuring that the
Administration has a coordinated strategy, this office will work to ensure
that the effort of American workers and businesses to produce creative and
innovative products and services is valued fairly around the world.

Spurring Progress in National Priority Areas
Much of the Administration’s innovation agenda is aimed at creating
a general economic environment that encourages innovation across the
board. But the Administration has also focused special attention on certain
areas where particular national needs are urgent. These include investments in building a “smart grid” to enhance the reliability, flexibility, and
efficiency of the electricity transmission grid; research on renewable energy
technologies like wind, solar, and biofuels; and support for research into
advanced vehicle technologies. These investments are motivated not only
by the perception that technological breakthroughs are possible and would
be highly valuable, but also by the enormous potential benefits that such
breakthroughs could have in terms of enhancing national security, mitigating pollution, and stemming climate change. These are also investments
that have a direct impact on creating high-paying, durable jobs—something
that is particularly valuable at a time of high unemployment. Thus, as noted
in Chapter 9, investments in the clean energy transformation involve two
layers of externalities: innovators fail to receive the full economic benefits
of their breakthroughs as measured by market valuation, and the market
valuation itself understates the true social benefits of the breakthroughs.
Another priority, given the looming threat that health care spending
poses to the Federal budget, is developing technologies for measuring
and monitoring health more efficiently. Through the Recovery Act,
the Administration has allocated substantial funds to development of a
21st-century system of medical recordkeeping that should jump-start work
in this area.

Increasing Openness and Transparency
To noneconomists, the idea that the legal system or the Patent Office
is a form of technology seems a bit of a stretch. Even more challenging is
the idea that a society’s overall degree of openness and transparency may
be a key determinant of economic progress. Yet a substantial body of
economic research has found that measures of openness and transparency

272  |  Chapter 10

in governmental policymaking processes have a strong association with
growth outcomes.
There are several reasons why this may be so. One fairly simple one
is that openness and transparency make it more difficult for special interests
to achieve their aims at the expense of the public. Another view, which is
not in conflict with the first, is that the process of requiring policies to be
explained and encouraging wide discussion about them yields new ideas and
improvements of existing ideas that might not otherwise have occurred even
to the cleverest and most well-motivated public servant.
A more speculative proposition is that a commitment to openness
and transparency on the part of the government is a form of investment in
the kind of “organizational capital” described earlier. Economic research
has found a strong correlation between measures of governmental transparency or openness and private sector productivity. Interpretations of this
relationship are a matter of debate; some scholars argue that higher levels
of productivity and income cause citizens to demand better government;
others argue that both governmental openness and private productivity are
a reflection of deeper unmeasured forces; and some advocate the straightforward view that open and transparent government has a direct effect in
producing greater private sector efficiency.
The Administration’s commitment in this area has been on full
display in the unprecedented openness and transparency surrounding
implementation of the Recovery Act. The most obvious manifestation of
this transparency is the creation of the independent Recovery Accountability
and Transparency Board charged with monitoring and reporting on the
government spending under the Act. Likewise, the requirement that recipients report on job creation and retention each quarter provides a new source
of information on the employment impact of the Act. The knowledge generated by the data collection and measurement under the Recovery Act will be
valuable in assessing economic policymaking for years to come.
The principles of openness, accountability, and public input are far
broader than just the Recovery Act, however. The Administration’s “open
government” initiative aims to harness the power of the Internet to bring the
same commitment to transparency and accountability to every part of the
Federal Government. New tools for this purpose are being developed not
only by government agencies but by the private sector, by open source software programmers, and by citizens around the country. It seems plausible
that eventually the new kinds of openness and transparency made possible
by new forms of technology will have the same kinds of positive effects on
growth that openness and transparency seem to have had across countries
in the past.
Fostering Productivity Growth Through Innovation and Trade  |  273

Trade as an Engine of Productivity Growth
and Higher Living Standards
Specialization has long been understood to be an important source of
productivity growth. In his Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith (1776) extolled
the virtues of specialization in the pin factory where many different specialized laborers were involved in producing a simple pin. Perhaps the most
important form of specialization is a transition from a subsistence society,
where people produce all their consumption goods themselves, to a market
economy, where people focus on particular skills and occupations and
depend on purchases for their daily needs. Another significant transition,
though, is one from a country that must produce everything its inhabitants
want to consume toward one that specializes in particular goods and services
and sells them on global markets for other goods and services.
Increases in trade and increases in GDP tend to go hand in hand, but
untangling whether economic growth is generating more trade or whether
trade is lifting growth is a difficult task. Creative research, however, has been
able to demonstrate the causal role trade plays in increasing the amount
a society can produce. One study demonstrated that countries that were
geographically better suited for trade (because of their proximity to trading
partners, access to ports, and the like) have higher levels of GDP (Frankel
and Romer 1999). Another demonstrated that the same relationship can be
seen across time (Feyrer 2009).3
Initially, trade was about introducing products (such as spices) from
one market to another, providing consumers with choices they previously
did not have. Still today, trade can offer consumers different goods and
different varieties of products already available to them and bring new
technology from other countries. By allowing countries to specialize based
on skills or endowments, trade can also allow countries to improve their
standards of living. Trade can also help a country increase its overall output
by allowing firms or industries to take advantage of economies of scale or
by encouraging the growth of more productive firms. Thus, trade has the
potential to increase the overall quantity of goods and services that a given
economy can produce with its resources—and hence increase the overall
standard of living—making global commerce a cooperative, not a competitive venture. A clear rules-based system with enforcement of those rules can
help ensure that trade is mutually beneficial.

The transition from sea to air traffic for much of the world’s trade has meant more of a
collapsing of distance for some nations than others. Because some sea-based trading routes are
inconvenient, a shift to air transport has increased trade more for some nations than others.
Controlling for other features, countries whose trade has increased due to this transition have
grown faster than other countries.

274  |  Chapter 10

While the act of specializing should lift living standards over time, it
requires shifting resources from one sector to another, and so can generate
short-run dislocations. As a result, it is essential to strengthen both targeted
and more general policies that seek to ensure all can benefit from increases
in trade. For this reason, after this section describes the productivityenhancing benefits trade can generate for the U.S. economy, the following
section discusses how progressive taxation and a strong social safety net are
crucial counterparts to productivity change of all types.

The United States and International Trade
Because of its massive size, the United States can engage in a
considerable amount of specialization and trade within its own economy.
Historically, foreign trade as a share of GDP has been smaller in the United
States than in most other countries. In 1970, exports as a share of GDP for
the average member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) was 25 percent, while in the United States, the share
was just 6 percent. By 2008, exports had increased to 13 percent of the U.S.
economy (see Figure 10-4). Although that share is still relatively small,
the increase in trade over the past four decades has meant that even in a
large country like the United States, global commerce is an important part
of the economy and—as discussed below—can be an important source of
productivity growth.

Millions of American workers contribute to the production of
goods and services that are exported to foreign markets, and their jobs, on
average, pay higher wages than a typical job. The Commerce Department
estimates that in 2008 U.S. exports represented the work of roughly
10 million American workers. The majority of these export-supported jobs
were related to the export of goods; millions more were related to services
exports and nearly a million were related to agricultural exports. The manufacturing sector is particularly connected to exports; 20 to 30 percent of
manufacturing employment in the United States in 2008 was supported by
exports. These estimates represent the number of job-equivalents based on
total hours needed to produce the volume of exports. Because few workers
produce exclusively exports or inputs for exports, the number of workers
who are involved with exports is likely much larger than 10 million.
Currently, the U.S. economy is far from full employment, and any
increased production could generate an increase in jobs. Chapter 4 discusses
how an increase in exports may be an important part of GDP growth in the
medium term. In the long run, though, the principal contribution of an
increase in the trade share will be the increase in productivity and living
standards it can generate. Thus, the rise in the export share of the economy
from 6 percent in 1970 to 13 percent today represents specialization, as
some workers who produced goods for domestic use have moved into
export sectors. The following sections describe the ways in which trade can
increase productivity.

Sources of Productivity Growth from International Trade
Productivity growth can come from a number of channels. Trade can
allow increased specialization; it can allow increased scale of production;
and it can allow more productive firms to grow rapidly, increasing their
share of the economy.
Specialization. In the United States, a primary source of trade-related
productivity growth is specialization. The concept of Ricardian comparative advantage—that nations specialize in producing the goods that they
can produce cheaply relative to other goods—can be seen in a number of
aspects of U.S. trade. America makes far more aircraft, grain, plastics, and
equipment (optical, photographic, and medical) than it consumes. In these
product areas, the United States has a substantial trade surplus, totaling over
$100 billion in 2008. Conversely, the United States produces less electrical
equipment, clothing, furniture, and toys than it consumes, and therefore
imports more of these goods than it exports. If America cut its production of aircraft, where it has a comparative advantage, by the $50 billion it

276  |  Chapter 10

currently exports on net and instead tried to produce more of the goods we
currently import, productivity would likely be lower.
Specialization also takes place within industries. For example, within
the broad category of “electrical machinery and equipment,” America
imports telephones (including cell phones) and computer monitors,
but exports electronic integrated circuits. Specialization can even take
place within more narrow product classifications (for example, computer
memory). Advanced countries with higher wages tend to produce and
export more high-quality products even as they import lower-cost, lowerquality products from abroad in the same product type. Economists
refer to this within-product differentiation as the “quality ladder,” and
extensive research in recent years has noted this pattern of specialization
within products (Schott 2004). Over time, high-skill countries climb the
quality ladder, making higher-quality products and increasingly importing
low-skill products.
For example, consider the category “electrically erasable programmable read-only memory.” The United States both imports and exports
billions of dollars worth of products in this category every year, but the
average unit price of the exports is roughly three times the average unit
price of the imports. The U.S. products may have bigger memories with
more complex production processes or be of higher quality than the cheaper
imports. In any event, the imports and exports do not appear to be overlapping. Again, such a division of labor allows for higher standards of living
across the world.
Intra-Industry Trade. Beyond specialization, trade can generate
productivity advances in a number of ways. One important channel is that
trade can allow companies to achieve a scale of production that they could
not attain by selling just to the local market, thus increasing their productivity. Within any given economy, there is a limit to the quantity of a specific
good that the domestic market will want to consume. The ability to manufacture more of a product than domestic consumption supports and exchange
it for other products—even ones that are extremely similar to the exported
good—can be quite beneficial. It results in economies of scale that can be
internal to a firm, where one company grows quite large and productive at
making one good, or to a region, where a particular good tends to be made in
a given physical location as a substantial amount of expertise builds up there.
Trade in which different quality or simply different brand products are
traded in both directions, known as intra-industry trade, represents between
40 and 50 percent of trade in the world economy. For the manufacturing
industry of the United States, that figure is even higher. As Figure 10-5
shows, intra-industry foreign trade moved from roughly 65 percent of U.S.

manufacturing trade in the 1980s to roughly 75 percent in 2001. Frequently,
this means two very similar countries engaging in trade with each other.
Five of the seven largest U.S. trading partners are advanced economies; in
fact, despite some observers’ focus on low-wage country imports, roughly
50 percent of U.S. imports come from other advanced economies. These
countries often have similar endowments of labor and are generally able
to use the same technology, but narrow specialization within product
classes, different brands, or differences in resource allocations allows for
productive exchange.

Firm Productivity. Trade can also allow productive firms to grow
relative to less productive firms as they increase their scale. A new literature
on “heterogeneous firms” has focused less on differences in endowments
or comparative advantage across countries and more on how firms within
an economy respond to trade. A crucial insight in this literature is that
most firms do not engage in trade, but those that do are on average more
productive and pay higher wages. This literature shows that when a
country opens to trade, more productive firms grow relative to less productive firms, thus shifting labor and other resources to the better organized
firms and increasing overall productivity. Even if workers do not switch
industries, they move from firms that are either poorly managed or that
278  |  Chapter 10

use less advanced technology and production processes toward the more
productive firms. Thus, firm-level evidence demonstrates that trade
allows not only economy-wide advances through resource allocation, but
also allows within-industry productivity advances through reallocation of
resources across firms. This shift has clear welfare-enhancing impacts; see
Bernard et al. (2007) for a general overview of this literature.
Vertical Specialization. Thus far, the discussion regarding sources of
productivity growth in international trade has assumed that finished goods
are being bought and sold across borders. The world of trade, though, has
changed substantially. Today, multinational corporations (U.S. or foreignbased) are involved in 64 percent of U.S. goods trade (imports and exports),
and fully 19 percent of U.S. goods exports are sales from a U.S. multinational
firm to its affiliates abroad. An increase in international vertical specialization, where firms have production in multiple countries and break up the
production of a particular good into stages across different countries, has
contributed significantly to growth in world trade. The process can be within
a large firm or intermediate inputs can be bought and sold on the market.
Decreased trade costs have made it easier to break up the value chain of
production as various parts of production can be done in different places
and an in-process good can be shipped many times before final assembly.
One study estimates that roughly one-third of the growth in world trade
from 1970 to 1990 was attributable to the growth in vertical-specialization
exports (Hummels, Ishii, and Yi 2001). Calculations about the extent of
vertical specialization vary from estimates that 30 percent of OECD exports
contain imported inputs to estimates that intermediate inputs account for
up to 60 percent of world trade.4
A trade system in which the same firms are both importers and
exporters complicates considerations of the impacts of trade on different
groups, as comparative advantage may not matter as much for a particular
good as for a particular task or piece of the production process. Specialization
by process should allow the United States to focus on jobs oriented toward
the processes that match the human capital, physical capital, and technology
in the United States, again increasing productivity. But it has also raised
fears that the process of adjustment could be disruptive, as a broader range
of jobs could be exposed to international competition. The crucial policy
goal is to harness the benefits of trade and ensure that its benefits are shared
broadly by all Americans.
4
The 30 percent figure refers specifically to the share of exports that is made from imported
inputs—sometimes called the vertical specialization of exports. The larger figure includes the
volume of trade that is imports of intermediate goods used in the production of goods for either
exports or the home market.

Encouraging Trade and Enforcing Trade Agreements
All of these aspects of trade highlight its potential to contribute to the
long-run expansion of productivity in the United States. Many of the advantages of increased trade come from opening foreign markets to the products
of U.S. workers. The best way to guarantee reliable access is through negotiated trade agreements and consistent enforcement of existing trade rules.
As noted in Chapter 3, one positive development in the recent crisis is that,
for the most part, countries did not resort to protectionism; that is, they did
not close their markets to imports. Had they done so, the dislocation in U.S.
employment would likely have been much worse. As it was, U.S. imports
of goods and services fell 34 percent and exports dropped 26 percent from
July 2008 to April 2009. From their peak in the third quarter of 2008 until
the trough in the second quarter of 2009, the nominal value of exports of
goods and services fell more than $400 billion at an annual rate, a drop of
almost 3 percent of GDP. Imports also dropped substantially. In the long
run, such a decline in world trade would be harmful for the U.S. economy.
If trade had stayed at that depressed level, with lower trade surpluses in the
United States’ main export goods and smaller trade deficits in our import
goods, the long-run dislocations from the crisis would have been worse than
now expected. But U.S. exports are rebounding, opening the possibility that
many workers who lost jobs in the crisis may find employment in the same
productive industries where they were before the crisis.
Several explanations have been offered for this avoidance of
protectionism during the crisis. One is the availability of macroeconomic
policy tools such as fiscal and monetary policy (Eichengreen and Irwin
2009); another is the public commitments made by leaders at the Group
of Twenty summits to avoid protectionist strategies. But the clear and
concrete rules-based trade system was helpful as well. That rules-based
system, embodied by the World Trade Organization (WTO) and by other
trade commitments, allows the United States to take steps to ensure that
other countries will abide by their obligations. It is also designed to give U.S.
workers and firms confidence about the economic environment they will be
facing and confidence that commitments made when trade agreements are
negotiated will be kept. In addition, creating predictable and enforceable
markets for innovative and creative works grounded in intellectual property
rights is essential to spurring and protecting U.S. investments in technology
and innovation.
The Administration recognizes that simply negotiating trade
frameworks is not enough; robust enforcement of trade rules is an important part of our engagement in the world economy. The Administration
has taken many trade enforcement actions recently. For example, the
280  |  Chapter 10

Administration has continued pressing a WTO case that challenged China’s
treatment of U.S. auto parts exports. The ruling in this case resulted in
China having to change its policies and increase its openness to U.S. exports.
The United States (joined by Mexico and the European Union) has also
initiated an action challenging China’s use of subsidies and taxes to keep
input costs low for firms in China, which lowers the cost of final goods from
China relative to the world. Further, the Administration takes very seriously the “Special 301” process under which it monitors the protection and
enforcement of intellectual property rights. In 2009, it added Canada to the
priority watch list because Canada has not implemented key proposals to
improve enforcement and protection of intellectual property rights. Actions
like these represent the Administration’s intent (made explicit, for example,
in United States Trade Representative Ronald Kirk’s speeches5) to enforce
trade rules and aggressively pursue actions to open markets to U.S. exports.
As noted in Chapter 4, the Administration is currently pursuing these
and other options to expand American exports, recognizing that increasing
exports will be a key part of the U.S. growth model. Increases in our exports
in the short run can help to return the economy to full employment. Over
the longer run, increases in trade provide avenues for the United States to
increase productivity through specialization, scale, and firm effects, and in
turn, increase standards of living for American families.
Currently, a number of other trade expansion opportunities exist for
the United States. The Administration supports a strong market-opening
agreement for both goods and services in the WTO Doha Round negotiations and is continuing to work with U.S. trade partners on potential free
trade agreements. Because the United States is a relatively open economy,
negotiated trade deals often involve substantial improvements in access for
U.S. exports to other countries relative to the market opening made by the
United States.
It is also important that these trade frameworks protect productivityenhancing innovation through adequate provisions for intellectual property
rights and that they reflect our values regarding workers and the environment. An example of the Administration’s actions to improve the world’s
trading regime is seen in the way the Administration is working to engage
our trading partners across the Pacific region in a new regional agreement
(the Trans-Pacific Partnership). It will be a high-standards agreement that
expands trade in a way that is beneficial to the economy, workers, small businesses, and farmers, and is consistent with the values of the United States.
In addition to benefits to the United States, trade benefits our trade
partners. This is of direct benefit to Americans in the sense that as these
5

economies grow, they can grow as a destination for U.S. exports. Trade
can also have large benefits for the poorest countries. In particular,
multilateral agreements that open trade flows between developing countries
can have substantial impacts on poorer countries, and trade relations with
the United States can be a crucial part of the path to development for the
poorest countries. For example, the African Growth and Opportunity Act
seeks to increase two-way trade with poor nations in sub-Saharan Africa,
help integrate these countries into the global economy, and do so in a way
that improves their institutions and reduces poverty. As development
in the poorest nations of the world is in our national interest strategically, economically, and morally, trade presents win-win opportunities to
advance development.

Ensuring the Gains from
Productivity Growth Are Widely Shared
Any productivity advance—be it from technological change, trade, or
other factors—will have different impacts across the economy. As discussed
earlier, productivity advances are crucial to an increase in living standards.
Still, those firms that do not make a specific advance will likely contract or
fail, and some workers in the affected industry may face losses. Likewise,
international trade can have disparate effects across industries, firms, and
workers. In both cases, society on average will be better off because the
economy is able to generate a higher standard of living. But the recent stagnation in median real wages despite positive productivity growth (discussed
in Chapter 8) highlights the challenge of ensuring that the gains from
productivity growth are widely spread.
The potential for productivity advances to generate disparities in
outcomes suggests the need for strong social policy to support those who
do not immediately benefit and to ensure that gains from trade and productivity advances are shared by all. Because identifying directly impacted
individuals is difficult, the logical response to productivity advances is a
strong social safety net that ensures that all benefit from the rise in living
standards. Trade theory suggests that trade liberalization can generate gains
that are large enough that they can be shared in a way that every member
of society is made better off. In the past, however, the gains from our trade
policies have not been shared sufficiently, and technological change and
globalization have left many behind.
Trade adjustment assistance, worker retraining, and temporary relief
programs are ways the Federal Government can and does support those

282  |  Chapter 10

who do not benefit from these advances. The Administration has supported
trade adjustment assistance, which provides additional unemployment
funds, retraining, and health coverage assistance, and has made trade adjustment assistance available to a wider set of employees through the Trade and
Globalization Adjustment Assistance Act of 2009.
These specific institutions, though, are not enough. More broad-based
policy must ensure that as the economy grows in the long run, it enhances
living standards for all citizens. Progressive taxation—which can be justified in many ways—is supported by the uneven outcomes from productivity
advances and globalization. Those whose incomes rise can pay a larger
share of total taxes and still be better off than before the gains. By doing
so, they support lower taxes for others whose incomes may have declined.
This process makes everyone better off and thus supports innovation and
open borders by minimizing the number of people who feel threatened by
productivity advances and therefore oppose them.
For example, the ability to sell books across borders certainly
enhanced the income J.K. Rowling was able to collect from writing the
famous Harry Potter books. Had she been able to sell her books only in
the United Kingdom, her audience and income would have been much
smaller. In addition, millions of American readers benefited from the
increased consumer choice and the ability to purchase her books. Similarly,
more Americans can work as well-paid aircraft engineers or manufacturing
employees for Boeing or as technology specialists for Apple because those
firms are able to sell on a world market. At the same time, it is distinctly
possible that some American authors who would have captured a larger
share of the “magic-oriented book” market had there been no trade in
literature were crowded out by Rowling’s success, or that some handheld
music device engineer in the United Kingdom has had to find another career
because of Apple’s success.
A progressive tax rate combined with trade allows those who realize
substantial income gains from globalization to still prosper a great deal relative to the state where there is no trade and incomes are taxed at a flat rate.
And it does so while making sure that those who face lower incomes from
globalization also obtain benefits—not just through the lower prices and
expanded choices associated with trade, but also through lower taxation.
Beyond a progressive tax rate, a strong social safety net can cushion
the disruption generated by a dynamic economy. Unemployment insurance
can provide temporary income. A robust health care system can ensure that
temporary dislocations do not generate drastic consequences. And a vibrant
education system can prepare workers for changing economic needs.

Conclusion
Advances in productivity are crucial to increasing the living standards
of all Americans—to building a better future. Innovation initiatives, such
as increased research and development, targeted investments, stronger
intellectual property rights, and harnessing trade’s productivity-enhancing
potential, are all essential parts of lifting living standards in the long run.
But to ensure living standards are rising for all, a dynamic open economy
depends on a robust social infrastructure. Education improvements
described in Chapter 8 are crucial to creating a well-trained labor force able
to thrive in a flexible economy where innovation and trade may reshape
industries over time. A sound health care system is needed to provide the
certainty that changing jobs will not mean a loss of health services. And a
productive, well-regulated financial system is essential to allocate capital
to growing sectors. Thus, the initiatives being taken today as part of the
Administration’s rescue-and-rebuild programs are not meant only to
correct the problems of today, but to set the stage for strong growth over
decades to come.

Activities of the Council of Economic Advisers During 2009  |  309

Report to the President
on the Activities of the
Council of Economic Advisers
During 2009
The Council of Economic Advisers was established by the Employment
Act of 1946 to provide the President with objective economic analysis and
advice on the development and implementation of a wide range of domestic
and international economic policy issues.

The Chair of the Council
Christina D. Romer was nominated as Chair of the Council by the
President on January 20, 2009. She was confirmed by the Senate on January
28, and took the oath of office on January 29. Dr. Romer is on a leave of
absence from the University of California, Berkeley, where she is the Class
of 1957-Garff B. Wilson Professor of Economics.
The Chair is a member of the President’s Cabinet and is responsible
for communicating the Council’s views on economic matters directly to the
President through personal discussions and written reports. Dr. Romer
represents the Council at the daily Presidential economics briefing, daily
White House senior staff meetings, budget meetings, Cabinet meetings, a
variety of inter-agency meetings, and other formal and informal meetings
with the President, the Vice President, and other senior government officials.
She also meets frequently with members of Congress in both formal hearings and informal meetings to discuss economic issues and Administration
priorities. She travels within the United States and overseas to present the
Administration’s views on the economy. Dr. Romer is the Council’s chief
public spokesperson. She directs the work of the Council and exercises
ultimate responsibility for the work of the professional staff.
Dr. Romer succeeded Edward P. Lazear, whose tenure ended with
the inauguration of the new President. Dr. Lazear returned to Stanford
University, where he is the Jack Steele Parker Professor of Human Resources
Management and Economics in the Graduate School of Business and the
Morris Arnold Cox Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution.

The Members of the Council
The other Members of the Council are Austan Goolsbee and Cecilia
Rouse. They were nominated by the President on January 20, 2009,
confirmed by the Senate on March 10, and took their oaths of office on
March 11. Dr. Goolsbee also serves as the Staff Director and Chief Economist
of the President’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board. Dr. Goolsbee is on
a leave of absence from the University of Chicago, where he is the Robert
P. Gwinn Professor of Economics in the Booth School of Business. Dr.
Rouse is on a leave of absence from Princeton University, where she is the
Theodore A. Wells ’29 Professor of Economics and Public Affairs. The
Members represent the Council at a wide variety of meetings and frequently
attend meetings with the President and the Vice President.
The Chair and the Members work as a team on most economic policy
issues. The Chair works on the whole range of issues under the Council’s
purview, with a particular focus on macroeconomics and health care. Dr.
Goolsbee focuses especially on issues related to housing, financial markets,
and tax policy. Dr. Rouse focuses especially on issues related to labor
markets, education, and international trade.
The term of Donald B. Marron as a Member of the Council ended
with the inauguration of the new President. He is currently president of
Marron Economics, LLC.

Areas of Activity
Macroeconomic Policies
A central function of the Council is to advise the President on all major
macroeconomic issues and developments. The Council is actively involved
in all aspects of macroeconomic policy. In 2009, the central macroeconomic
issues included monitoring the financial and economic crisis; formulating
the policy response, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act of 2009, the Financial Stability Plan, and additional measures targeted to
spur job creation and deal with problems in specific sectors; evaluating the
effects of the policies and the economy’s response; health insurance reform;
and setting priorities for the budget. In this process, the Council works
closely with the Department of the Treasury, the Office of Management and
Budget, the National Economic Council, White House senior staff, and other
agencies and officials.
The Council prepares for the President, the Vice President, and the
White House senior staff a daily economic briefing memo analyzing current
economic developments, and almost-daily memos on key economic data
312  |  Appendix A

releases. The Chair also makes more in-depth presentations on the state of
the economy to these officials and to the Cabinet.
The Council, the Department of Treasury, and the Office of
Management and Budget—the Administration’s economic “troika”—
are responsible for producing the economic forecasts that underlie the
Administration’s budget proposals. The Council initiates the forecasting
process twice each year, consulting with a wide variety of outside sources,
including leading private sector forecasters and other government agencies.
The Council issued a series of reports in 2009. Among those most
directly related to macroeconomic policy were a report issued in May on
estimation methodology for the jobs impact of specific programs of the
Recovery Act; a report in June on the economic effects of comprehensive
health insurance reform; a report in September on the macroeconomic
effects of the Recovery Act; and three shorter reports accompanying that
report focusing on the effects of state fiscal relief, the effects of the “Cash for
Clunkers” program, and the cross-country experience with fiscal policy in
the crisis.
The Council continued its efforts to improve the public’s
understanding of economic developments and of the Administration’s
economic policies through briefings with the economic and financial press,
discussions with outside economists, and presentations to outside organizations. The Chair and Members also regularly met to exchange views on the
macroeconomy with the Chairman and Members of the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System.

Microeconomic Policies
Throughout the year, the Council was an active participant in the
analysis and consideration of a broad range of microeconomic policy issues.
The Council was actively engaged in policy discussions on health insurance
reform, financial regulatory reform, clean energy, the environment, education, and numerous labor market issues. As with macroeconomic policy, the
Council works closely with other economic agencies, White House senior
staff, and other agencies on these issues. Among the specific microeconomic issues that received particular attention in 2009 were small business
lending; foreclosure mitigation and prevention; unemployment insurance;
the condition and prospects of the American automobile industry; the role
of cost-benefit analysis in regulatory policy; estimating the social benefits
of reduced carbon emissions; reform of K-12 education; student financial
aid; community colleges; potential developments in the U.S. labor market
over the next five to ten years; and key indicators of family well-being in the
recession and accompanying policy responses.

Many of the reports issued by the Council in 2009 were primarily
concerned with microeconomic issues. In addition to its major health care
report in June, the Council issued three other reports on health insurance
reform over the course of the year—one on its impact on small businesses
and their employees in July, one on its impact on state and local governments in September, and an update of the June report in December. The
Council also issued an extensive report on the “jobs of tomorrow” in July
and a report on simplifying student aid in September.

International Economic Policies
The Council was involved in a range of international trade and finance
issues, with a particular emphasis on the consequences of the international
financial crisis and the related global economic slowdown. The Council was
an active participant in discussions at global and bilateral levels. Council
Members and staff regularly met with economists, policy officials, and
government officials of other countries to discuss issues relating to the global
economy and participated in the first Strategic and Economic Dialogue with
China in July 2009.
The Council was particularly active in examining policies that could
help speed the global economy out of the current crisis.  It carefully tracked
developments in the global economy and considered the potential mediumrun impacts of the current crisis.  It was also an active participant in the
Presidential Study Directive examining the development policies of the
United States Government, providing analysis and support to the effort
to review the interactions between the United States and countries in the
developing world.
On the international trade front, the Council was an active
participant in the trade policy process, occupying a position on the Trade
Policy Staff Committee and the Trade Policy Review Group.  The Council
provided analysis and recommendations on a range of trade-related issues
involving the enforcement of existing trade agreements, reviews of current
U.S. trade policies, and consideration of future policies.  The Council was
also an active participant on the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee,
helping to examine the ways in which exports may support economic
growth in the years to come.  In the area of investment and security, the
Council participated on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United
States (CFIUS), discussing individual cases before CFIUS.
The Council is a leading participant in the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD), an important forum for economic
cooperation among high-income industrial economies.  Dr. Romer is

314  |  Appendix A

chair of the OECD’s Economic Policy Committee, and Council staff
participate actively in working-party meetings on macroeconomic policy
and coordination.

Public Information
The Council’s annual Economic Report of the President is an
important vehicle for presenting the Administration’s domestic and international economic policies. It is available for purchase through the Government
Printing Office, and is viewable on-line at www.gpoaccess.gov/eop.
The Council prepared numerous reports in 2009, and the Chair and
Members gave numerous public speeches and testified to Congress. The
reports, texts of speeches, and written statements accompanying testimony
are available at the Council’s website, www.whitehouse.gov/cea.
Finally, the Council publishes the monthly Economic Indicators,
which is available on-line at www.gpoaccess.gov/indicators.

General Notes
Detail in these tables may not add to totals because of rounding.
Because of the formula used for calculating real gross domestic
product (GDP), the chained (2005) dollar estimates for the detailed
components do not add to the chained-dollar value of GDP or to
any intermediate aggregate. The Department of Commerce (Bureau
of Economic Analysis) no longer publishes chained-dollar estimates
prior to 1995, except for selected series.
Unless otherwise noted, all dollar figures are in current dollars.
Symbols used:
p Preliminary.
... Not available (also, not applicable).
Data in these tables reflect revisions made by the source agencies
through January 29, 2010. In particular, tables containing national
income and product accounts (NIPA) estimates reflect revisions
released by the Department of Commerce in July 2009.

Note (cont’d): Value added is the contribution of each private industry and of government to GDP. Value added is equal to an industry’s gross output minus
its intermediate inputs. Current-dollar value added is calculated as the sum of distributions by an industry to its labor and capital, which are derived from the
components of gross domestic income.
Value added industry data shown in Tables B–12 and B–13 are based on the 1997 North American Industry Classiﬁcation System (NAICS). GDP by industry
data based on the Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation (SIC) are available from the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis.

1 Inventories at end of quarter. Quarter-to-quarter change calculated from this table is not the current-dollar change in private inventories component of
gross domestic product (GDP). The former is the difference between two inventory stocks, each valued at its respective end-of-quarter prices. The latter is
the change in the physical volume of inventories valued at average prices of the quarter. In addition, changes calculated from this table are at quarterly rates,
whereas change in private inventories is stated at annual rates.
2 Inventories of construction, mining, and utilities establishments are included in other industries through 1995.
3 Quarterly totals at monthly rates. Final sales of domestic business equals ﬁnal sales of domestic product less gross output of general government, gross
value added of nonproﬁt institutions, compensation paid to domestic workers, and space rent for owner-occupied housing. Includes a small amount of ﬁnal
sales by farm and by government enterprises.
Note: The industry classiﬁcation of inventories is on an establishment basis. Estimates through 1995 are based on the Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation
(SIC). Beginning with 1996, estimates are based on the North American Industry Classiﬁcation System (NAICS).

reference person.
2 Current dollar median money income adjusted by consumer price index research series (CPI-U-RS).
3 Reﬂects implementation of Census 2000–based population controls comparable with succeeding years.
4 Reﬂects household sample expansion.
5 For 2004, ﬁgures are revised to reﬂect a correction to the weights in the 2005 Annual Social and Economic Supplement.
6 Data are for “white alone,” for “white alone or in combination,” for “black alone,” and for “black alone or in combination.” (“Black” is also “black
or African American.”) Beginning with data for 2002 the Current Population Survey allowed respondents to choose more than one race; for earlier years
respondents could report only one race group.
Note: Poverty thresholds are updated each year to reﬂect changes in the consumer price index (CPI-U).

5 Not strictly comparable with earlier data due to population adjustments or other changes. See Employment and Earnings or population control adjustments
to the Current Population Survey (CPS) at http://www.bls.gov/cps/documentation.htm#concepts for details on breaks in series.
6 Beginning in 2000, data for agricultural employment are for agricultural and related industries; data for this series and for nonagricultural employment are
not strictly comparable with data for earlier years. Because of independent seasonal adjustment for these two series, monthly data will not add to total civilian
employment.
Note: Labor force data in Tables B–35 through B–44 are based on household interviews and relate to the calendar week including the 12th of the month. For
deﬁnitions of terms, area samples used, historical comparability of the data, comparability with other series, etc., see Employment and Earnings or population
control adjustments to the CPS at http://www.bls.gov/cps/documentation.htm#concepts.

1 Annual data are averages of monthly not seasonally adjusted ﬁgures.
2 Unﬁlled orders are seasonally adjusted, end of period. Ratios are unﬁlled orders at end of period to shipments for period (excludes industries with no
unﬁlled orders). Annual ratios relate to seasonally adjusted data for December.
3 Effective in 2001, data classiﬁed based on North American Industry Classiﬁcation System (NAICS). Data on NAICS basis available beginning with
1992. Earlier data based on the Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation (SIC). Data on SIC basis include semiconductors. Data on NAICS basis do not include
semiconductors.
Note: For NAICS basis data beginning with 1992, because there are no unﬁlled orders for manufacturers’ nondurable goods, manufacturers’ nondurable new
orders and nondurable shipments are the same (see Table B–58).

1 Consumer price index, all urban consumers.
2 CPI-U-X1 reﬂects a rental equivalence approach to homeowners’ costs for the CPI-U for years prior to 1983, the ﬁrst year for which the ofﬁcial index
incorporates such a measure. CPI-U-X1 is rebased to the December 1982 value of the CPI-U (1982–84=100) and is identical with CPI-U data from December 1982
forward. Data prior to 1967 estimated by moving the series at the same rate as the CPI-U for each year.
3 Consumer price index research series (CPI-U-RS) using current methods introduced in June 1999. Data for 2009 are preliminary. All data are subject to
revision annually.
4 Chained consumer price index (C-CPI-U) introduced in August 2002. Data for 2008 and 2009 are subject to revision.

2 Yields on the more actively traded issues adjusted to constant maturities by the Department of the Treasury. The 30-year Treasury constant maturity series
was discontinued on February 18, 2002, and reintroduced on February 9, 2006.
3 Beginning with December 7, 2001, data for corporate Aaa series are industrial bonds only.
4 Effective rate (in the primary market) on conventional mortgages, reﬂecting fees and charges as well as contract rate and assuming, on the average,
repayment at end of 10 years. Rates beginning with January 1973 not strictly comparable with prior rates.
5 For monthly data, high and low for the period. Prime rate for 1929–1933 and 1947–1948 are ranges of the rate in effect during the period.
6 Primary credit replaced adjustment credit as the Federal Reserve's principal discount window lending program effective January 9, 2003.
7 Since July 19, 1975, the daily effective rate is an average of the rates on a given day weighted by the volume of transactions at these rates. Prior to that
date, the daily effective rate was the rate considered most representative of the day's transactions, usually the one at which most transactions occurred.
8 From October 30, 1942 to April 24, 1946, a preferential rate of 0.50 percent was in effect for advances secured by Government securities maturing in one
year or less.

2 Data on Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation (SIC) basis include transportation and public utilities. Those on North American Industry Classiﬁcation System

(NAICS) basis include transporation and warehousing. Utilities classiﬁed separately in NAICS (as shown beginning 1998).
3 SIC-based industry data use the 1987 SIC for data beginning in 1987 and the 1972 SIC for prior data. NAICS-based data use 2002 NAICS.
Note: Industry data on SIC basis and NAICS basis are not necessarily the same and are not strictly comparable.

1 In the old series, “income taxes” refers to Federal income taxes only, as State and local income taxes had already been deducted. In the new series, no
income taxes have been deducted
2 Annual data are average equity for the year (using four end-of-quarter ﬁgures)
3 Beginning with 1988, proﬁts before and after income taxes reﬂect inclusion of minority stockholders’ interest in net income before and after income taxes
4 Data for 1992 (most signiﬁcantly 1992:I) reﬂect the early adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 106 (Employer’s Accounting for
Post-Retirement Beneﬁts Other Than Pensions) by a large number of companies during the fourth quarter of 1992. Data for 1993 (1993:I) also reﬂect adoption of
Statement 106. Corporations must show the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the ﬁrst quarter of the year in which the change is adopted.
5 Data based on the North American Industry Classiﬁcation System (NAICS). Other data shown are based on the Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation (SIC).
Note: Data are not necessarily comparable from one period to another due to changes in accounting principles, industry classiﬁcations, sampling procedures,
etc. For explanatory notes concerning compilation of the series, see Quarterly Financial Report for Manufacturing, Mining, and Trade Corporations, Department
of Commerce, Bureau of the Census.

Note: Farm output includes primary agricultural activities and certain secondary activities that are closely linked to agricultural production for which
information on production and input use cannot be separately observed. Secondary output (alternatively, farm-related output) includes recreation activities, the
imputed value of employer-provided housing, land rentals under the Conservation Reserve, and services such as custom machine work and custom livestock
feeding.

1 End-use commodity classiﬁcations beginning 1978 and 1989 are not strictly comparable with data for earlier periods. See Survey of Current Business,
June 1988 and July 2001.
Note: Data are on a balance of payments basis and exclude military. In June 1990, end-use categories for goods exports were redeﬁned to include
reexports (exports of foreign goods); beginning with data for 1978, reexports are assigned to detailed end-use categories in the same manner as exports of
domestic goods.

4 Total includes “other” exports or imports, not shown separately.
5 Total arrivals of imported goods other than in-transit shipments.
6 Total includes revisions not reﬂected in detail.

Note: Goods on a Census basis are adjusted to a BOP basis by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, in line with concepts and deﬁnitions used to prepare
international and national accounts. The adjustments are necessary to supplement coverage of Census data, to eliminate duplication of transactions recorded
elsewhere in international accounts, and to value transactions according to a standard deﬁnition.
Data include international trade of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Foreign Trade Zones.

1 Prior to 1991 data are for West Germany only.
2 Civilian unemployment rates, approximating U.S. concepts. Quarterly data for France, Germany, and Italy should be viewed as less precise indicators of

unemployment under U.S. concepts than the annual data.
3 There are breaks in the series for Canada (1994), France (1982, 1990, and 2003), Germany (1984, 1991, 1999, and 2005), Italy (1986, 1991, and 1993), and
United States (1990 and 1994). For details, see International Comparisons of Annual Labor Force Statistics, Adjusted to U.S. Concepts, 10 Countries, 1970–2008,
October 1, 2009, Appendix B, at http://www.bls.gov/ﬂs/ﬂscomparelf/notes.htm#country_notes.
4 Hourly compensation in manufacturing, U.S. dollar basis; data relate to all employed persons (employees and self-employed workers). For details on
manufacturing hourly compensation, see International Comparisons of Manufacturing Productivity and Unit Labor Cost Trends, 2008, October 22, 2009.
