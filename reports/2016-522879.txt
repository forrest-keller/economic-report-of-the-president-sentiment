economic report of the president

To the Congress of the United States:
When I took office, our Nation was in the midst of the worst
recession since the Great Depression. The economy was shedding 800,000
jobs a month. The auto industry was on the brink of collapse, and our
manufacturing sector was in decline. Many families were struggling to pay
their bills and make ends meet. Millions more saw their savings evaporate,
even as retirement neared.
Seven years later, thanks to the grit and determination of the
American people, the United States of America has rebuilt, reformed, and
emerged as the strongest, most durable economy in the world.
We are in the middle of the longest streak of private-sector job
creation in history: 14 million new jobs; the strongest two years of job
growth since the ‘90s; an unemployment rate cut in half. Manufacturing
has added 900,000 jobs in the past six years, and our auto industry just
had its best year of sales ever. We are less reliant on foreign oil than at any
point in the previous four decades. Nearly 18 million people have gained
health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, cutting the uninsured rate
to a record low. And we’ve done all this while dramatically cutting our
budget deficit.
In 2015, we continued to take steps forward, with strong job growth
and wages rising at their fastest rate in the recovery. Here in Washington,
Congress came together to pass a budget, secure long-term transportation
funding, reform education laws, and make tax cuts for working families
permanent.
So claims that America’s economy is in decline or that we haven’t
made progress are simply not true. What is true—and the reason that a
Economic Report of the President  |  3

lot of Americans feel anxious—is that the economy has been changing
in profound ways, starting long before the Great Recession. Today,
technology doesn’t just replace jobs on the assembly line, but rather affects
any job where work can be automated. Companies in a global economy
face tougher competition from abroad, and they can locate anywhere. As
a result, workers have less leverage for a raise. And more and more wealth
and income is concentrated at the very top.
All these trends have squeezed workers, making it difficult for
middle-class families to feel secure, even when they have jobs and the
economy is growing. For the past seven years, our goal has been not just
strengthening economic growth but also creating an economy where
everyone who works hard gets a fair shot. We’ve made progress. But we
need to make more. And we must choose policies that not only make us
stronger today, but also reflect the kind of country we aspire to be in the
coming decades.
Real opportunity requires every American to get the education and
training they need to land a good-paying job. Together, we’ve increased
access to early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to
new highs, and boosted graduates in fields like engineering. In the coming
years, we should build on that progress, by providing pre-school for all,
offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes
that make them job-ready on day one, and recruiting and supporting
more great teachers for our kids. And we have to make college affordable
for every American. Because no hardworking student should be saddled
with unmanageable debt. We’ve already doubled investments in college
scholarships and tax credits and capped student loan payments to 10
percent of a borrower’s income. Now, we need colleges to find innovative
ways to cut costs and help more students finish their degrees.
Of course, a great education isn’t all we need in this new economy.
We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of
security. Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever, and
we shouldn’t weaken them; we should strengthen them. For Americans
short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything
else is today. That’s part of what the Affordable Care Act is all about. It
helps fill the gaps in employer-based care so that when we lose a job, or go
back to school, or start that new business, we’ll still have coverage.
We can build on this progress by further strengthening our social
safety net and modernizing it for the changing economy. For example,

4  |  Economic Report of the President

when a hardworking American loses his job—we shouldn’t just make sure
he can get unemployment insurance; we should make sure that program
encourages him to retrain for a business that’s ready to hire him. If that
new job doesn’t pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance
in place so that he can still pay his bills. And even if he’s going from job
to job, it shouldn’t be difficult for him to save for retirement and take his
savings with him. That’s the way we make the economy work better for
everyone.
But there are broader choices to make about what role the government
should play in making sure the system’s not rigged in favor of the wealthiest
and biggest corporations. A thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our
economy, and we can all agree that there are outdated regulations that
need to be changed, and red tape that needs to be cut. But after years of
record corporate profits, working families won’t have more opportunities
or see faster wage growth by letting the biggest companies make their own
rules at the expense of everyone else; or by allowing attacks on collective
bargaining to go unanswered.
In this new economy, workers and start-ups and small businesses
need more of a voice, not less. The rules should work for them. And
this year I plan to lift up the many businesses that have figured out that
doing right by their workers ends up being good for their shareholders,
their customers, and their communities, so that we can spread those best
practices across America.
In fact, many of our best corporate citizens are also our most
creative, and that spirit of innovation is essential to helping us meet
our biggest challenges. Over the past seven years, we have nurtured
that spirit by protecting an open Internet, creating online tools to help
entrepreneurs start their businesses in a single day, and taking bold new
steps to get more students and low-income Americans online. But we
can do so much more, especially for medical research and clean energy
sources. With 2015 marking the warmest year on record, we need to build
on our existing investments in clean energy and accelerate the transition
away from fossil fuels.
At the same time, I’ll keep pushing forward on work that still
needs to be done, like fixing our broken immigration system, raising
the minimum wage, providing two years of free community college to
responsible students, ensuring equal pay for equal work, opening U.S.
exports to new markets, and expanding tax cuts for low-income workers

without kids. All these things still matter to hardworking families; they
are still the right thing to do, and I will not let up until they get done.
I have never been more optimistic about America’s future than I am
today. Over the past seven years, I have seen the strength, resilience, and
commitment of the American people. I know that when we are united in
the face of challenges, our Nation emerges stronger and better than before.
And when we work together, there are no limits to what we can achieve.

INCLUSIVE GROWTH IN
THE UNITED STATES

T

he U.S. economic recovery entered its seventh year in 2015. Our
businesses created 2.6 million jobs in 2015 and the unemployment
rate fell to 5.0 percent, half its level in fall 2009, far faster than forecasters
expected. Private domestic final purchases—the most stable and persistent
components of economic output—rose 2.7 percent over the four quarters of
the year, bolstered by solid personal consumption, strong residential investment, and record-setting investment in research and development. Health
care price growth remained at low levels not seen in nearly five decades as the
Nation’s uninsured rate fell below 10 percent for the first time ever. Overall,
consumers were more confident about the economy than in any year since
2004. Nominal wage growth remained too low, but still grew faster in 2015
than at any time since the recovery began. While more work remains to be
done on each of these fronts—especially in terms of wage growth—the U.S.
economy exhibited substantial strength throughout the year.
At the same time, slowing foreign demand has weighed on exports
and impacted the manufacturing sector, low oil prices—while boosting
household balance sheets—have constrained investment and job growth in
the drilling industry, and financial market volatility is also impacting the
economy. The divergence between strong domestic demand and these global
factors will remain an important macroeconomic dynamic in 2016.
But we must not lose sight of the longer-term challenges that the U.S.
economy has faced for decades, most notably the insufficient growth of
middle-class incomes. Last year’s Economic Report of the President focused
on the three factors that drive middle-class incomes: productivity growth,
inequality, and participation in our economy. This year’s Report examines
the economics and policies that can strengthen productivity without exacerbating inequality, promoting robust and inclusive growth that can be shared
by a broad group of households. Many of these policies increase economic

21

efficiency as well as equity, unleashing productivity growth that benefits
families across the income distribution.
Despite progress during the recovery and promising economic trends,
inequality remains a defining challenge of the 21st century economy. This
is a global issue, but one that is particularly salient in the United States.
While rising income and wealth inequality tend to attract the most attention, the last few decades have seen an especially unequal distribution of
something more fundamental—the opportunity to succeed in our economy.
Too many Americans’ ability to innovate and participate in the labor force
is constrained by their circumstances. For example, children of low-income
families face broad disadvantages that limit their ability to get ahead in
school and later in life; our criminal justice system fosters inequities and
inefficiencies that limit opportunity; and persistent biases against women
and minorities limit their full economic participation. Unequal outcomes
often reward hard work and innovation, and may promote the efficient use
of our resources and raise overall living standards. But unequal outcomes
that arise from unequal opportunities—barriers that keep some individuals
from realizing their full potential—are a detriment to growth and fairness.
The President supports a wide range of policies to promote equality of
opportunity for all Americans, detailed extensively later in this chapter.
The overall increase in income inequality in recent decades is large
enough to accommodate many partial explanations. The traditional view
is that inequality arises from competitive markets, paying workers, investors, and innovators according to their productivity—with divergences
in productivity stemming from changes in technology, globalization, and
education. Such a mechanism promotes productivity growth by encouraging
productive labor, wise investments, and innovation.
But many economists have recently emphasized another contributor to rising income inequality: “economic rents.” Rents are unproductive
income paid to labor or capital above what is necessary to keep that labor
at work or that capital invested. Rents arise when markets are not perfectly
competitive, such as when uncompetitive markets yield monopoly profits
or preferential regulation protects entities from competition. For example,
a firm might be willing to sell a piece of software for $20 based on costs
and a reasonable return to capital. But if the firm has no competition, it
may be able to sell the same product for $50—the $30 difference reflects
an economic rent. Rents can serve a productive purpose in encouraging
innovation. Some rents are inevitable, but the critical question is how they
are divided—for example, between profits and wages. And in many cases the
evidence suggests that the pursuit of such rents (“rent-seeking behavior”)
exacerbates inequality and can actually impair growth.
22  |  Chapter 1

To promote inclusive growth, both channels of inequality—competitive markets and economic rents—must be addressed from a pro-growth
perspective. Since the competitive channel most effectively promotes growth
when competition is open to the widest set of economic actors, promoting
equality of opportunity helps the competitive channel work better. And
because the abuse of market power in pursuit of economic rents results in
inherently unproductive inequality, strategies to reduce such unfair advantages can promote equality and opportunity. Both of these broad goals
would reduce inequality while unleashing productivity growth, raising living
standards across the income distribution.

Forms of Economic Inequality:
Income, Wealth, and Opportunity
Unequal outcomes may provide incentives for individual effort and
therefore play a productive role in the economy. Large rewards can motivate
innovators, entrepreneurs, and workers and compensate them for taking
large personal risks—choices that, in some cases, can benefit households
more broadly across the economy. Hard work and personal capital developed the first personal computer; its developer reaped great rewards, but so
too did aggregate productivity. Inequality can also simply reflect the choices
of two otherwise identical people who make different decisions about how to
balance work versus leisure, or an undesirable job versus a desirable job. But
excessive inequality may also reflect substantially more than “just deserts,”
ranging from pure luck to economic rents. Moreover, while inequality can
play an important role in economic growth, excessive inequality is not necessarily essential to growth and may even impede growth. This is especially
true to the degree that inequality derives from interfering with the competitive market or protecting high returns to capital or labor with barriers,
natural or otherwise.
To understand how to promote widely shared growth, it is critical to
distinguish among various forms of economic inequality to better understand their sources. This Report considers three broad forms: inequality of
income, inequality of wealth, and inequality of opportunity. All are closely
related and can influence one another.

Income Inequality
Although a global issue, income inequality is particularly important
in the United States in terms of both its level and in recent changes. Large
advanced economies have seen a persistent trend of rising inequality for
decades, as the very highest earners capture a larger share of aggregate
Inclusive Growth in the United States  |  23

income. Until the 1980s, the United States experience was similar to other
countries; as recently as 1975, the top 1 percent garnered a similar share of
the income in the United States as in other G-7 countries, as shown in Figure
1-1. But since 1987 the share of income going to the top 1 percent in the
United States has exceeded every other G-7 country in each year that data
are available. Moreover, the United States has continued to diverge further
from other advanced economies, with the top 1 percent’s income share rising 0.2 percentage point a year on average in the United States from 1990
to 2010, well above the 0.1 percentage point average increase in the United
Kingdom. While comparable international data are scarce after 2010, the
gains of the top 1 percent have continued in the United States. In 2014, the
top 1 percent captured 18 percent of income, up from 8 percent in 1975
(World Top Incomes Database 2015).
In contrast to rising inequality within countries, inequality across
the globe as a whole has been largely stable and possibly even decreasing.
Fast growth in many poorer and emerging countries has lifted hundreds of
millions of people out of poverty in recent decades, moderating the trends
observed in the advanced world. In fact, when measured at a global level, the
biggest income gains from 1988 to 2008 went to households between the 15th
percentile and the 65th percentile of global income (Milanovic 2012).
The dynamics of income inequality across many countries have
gained considerable attention in recent years, perhaps most notably in
Thomas Piketty’s 2014 work Capital in the Twenty-First Century. Following
Piketty, previous Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) analysis has decomposed inequality into three components:
•  Inequality within labor income (wages, salaries, and benefits);
•  
Inequality within capital income (capital gains, dividends, and
interest); and
•  The division of aggregate income between labor and capital.
All three of these have different causes, dynamics, and policy
implications.
CEA has decomposed the changes in inequality in the United States
into the three sources using a combination of data from Piketty and his colleague Emmanuel Saez, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and
the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA). Figures 1-2a and
1-2b shows the top 1 percent shares of labor and capital income according
to various datasets.
The data present several issues with volatility, systematic measurement error that results from using administrative tax data in an environment
of changing tax policies, and definitional nuances around what should be

classified as labor or capital income. Nonetheless, this decomposition exercise illustrates a few broad points.
In the United States, the top 1 percent’s share of total income rose
from 8 percent in 1970 to 17 percent in 2010, according to the Piketty-Saez
data. Throughout this period, the top 1 percent’s share of labor income rose
steadily while its share of capital income only began a sustained rise around
1990, as shown in Figure 1-2a. Overall, the 9-percentage-point increase in
the share of income that Piketty and Saez find going to the top 1 percent
from 1970 to 2010 is attributable to the three factors discussed above in the
following dimensions: 68 percent due to increased inequality within labor
income; 32 percent due to increased inequality within capital income; and 0
percent due to a shift in income from labor to capital. This finding is broadly
consistent with the recent emphasis on labor income inequality, though it
tells us that capital income is also a reasonably important driver of income
inequality. Other data discussed below show a bigger share for the shift from
labor to capital income.
However, when looking at the extreme upper end of the income
distribution in more recent periods, capital income becomes much more
important. Table 1-1 shows the relative importance of the distribution of
income within labor in explaining the increased share of income going to
the top in different data sets and different periods.

The higher up the income scale, the less important inequality within
labor income is in explaining the overall increase in inequality, and the commensurately more important the degree of inequality within capital income.
There is a strong temporal pattern as well, with inequality within capital
income becoming increasingly important over time. The relevant CBO data
only go back to 1979 and do not show any finer measurements than the top
1 percent, but they tell a similar story both in terms of the overall magnitudes
and in terms of within-capital inequality being more important higher up
the income scale.

Inequality within Labor Income
The topic of inequality within labor income has been studied extensively. As a factual matter, those at the very top of the income distribution
(top 0.1 percent) are about 40 percent managers in non-financial industries and about 20 percent financial professionals, with the remaining 40
percent spread across law, medicine, real estate, entrepreneurship, arts,
media, sports, and other occupations (Bakija, Cole, and Heim 2010). A
variety of explanations have been put forward for the overall rise in labor
income inequality, including the increased return to skills, especially given
technological change, the increased national and global reach of corporations, the slowdown in increases in educational attainment (weakening the
skill base and earning power of the lower part of the income distribution),
and changes in norms and corporate governance (such that a wider gap
between CEO and worker pay is now acceptable). The rising importance
of unproductive economic rents is likely also contributing to the broad
increase in inequality. Workers and managers at firms earning supernormal
Inclusive Growth in the United States  |  27

return—likely reflecting increased aggregate rents—are paid progressively
more than their counterparts at other firms. Moreover, as union membership declines, inequality can rise further as workers at the bottom of the
income distribution lose market power.

Inequality within Capital Income
A second source of increased inequality is the distribution of capital
income. As the distribution of wealth becomes increasingly unequal, the
returns to that wealth—like interest, dividends, and capital gains—will generate more inequality. In addition, the fact that those at higher wealth levels
seem to receive higher returns to capital, when coupled with reductions in
tax rates on capital income in recent decades, has increased the contribution
of capital income to overall inequality. Further, if some firms earn monopoly
profits, owners of those firms may benefit more than others. These issues
have been studied much less than labor income inequality, though they
clearly merit much more attention given their increasing importance over
time.
Division of Income between Labor and Capital
Wealth is much more unequally distributed than labor income. As a
result, the extent to which aggregate income is divided between returns to
labor and returns to wealth (capital income) matters for aggregate inequality. When the labor share of income falls, the offsetting increase in capital
income (returns to wealth) is distributed especially unequally, increasing
overall inequality. In Europe, the share of income going to labor has been
falling since about 1970. In contrast, a marked decline in the labor share of
income occurred only after 2000 in the United States, though there is some
volatility in the data. The relative importance of this factor in the overall
increase in inequality is harder to consistently quantify, although the importance of labor and capital income inequality in recent decades suggests that
it plays only a supporting role.

Wealth Inequality
When unequally distributed income is saved, it results in unequally
distributed wealth. Growing wealth inequality in the United States reflects
many of the trends and many of the same causes as rising income inequality.
Wealth inequality is particularly difficult to measure accurately because we
do not track wealth in the way we do income and trends in wealth inequality are concentrated among a small number of households. One perspective
on wealth inequality comes from the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer
Finances (SCF) which, as shown in Figure 1-3, shows that the top 3 percent

of households have held more than 50 percent of aggregate wealth since
2007 (Bricker et al., 2014). This share has been on a consistent uptrend since
the late 1980s. The next 7 percent of households in the wealth distribution
hold roughly 25 percent of aggregate wealth, a share that been fairly stable
time during this period. Notably, the loss in wealth share experienced by the
bottom 90 percent of households, which in 2013 held only 25 percent of all
wealth is accounted for by the rise in share captured by the top 3 percent.
This is not a uniform spreading of the wealth distribution; it is a rising concentration of wealth at the very top.
An alternative analysis by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman finds
that the rise in wealth inequality is due to the very top of the wealth distribution. Using capital income reported on tax returns, they estimate that the
share of wealth held by the top 0.1 percent of households has more than
tripled, from 7 percent of total household wealth in 1979 to 22 percent in
2012—reversing a decline over the prior decades.1 As shown in Figure 1-4,
the wealth share of these households (approximately 160,000 families with
average net wealth per family above $20.6 million) is now nearly as large as
it was in 1929 (Saez and Zucman 2015).
1 Any method to measure wealth is imperfect and unlike income, individuals are not required
to report the value of their wealth each year, so there is no administrative data to use as a
benchmark for the distribution, the two methods discussed here each have their advantages
and disadvantages. (Bricker et al 2015, Saez and Zucman 2015).

Saez and Zucman argue that this increase in wealth concentration
is compounded by an increase in differences in saving rates across wealth
classes (for instance, wealthier individuals save a larger percentage of their
income). More generally, they hypothesize that income inequality has a
“snowballing effect” on the wealth distribution: a larger share of income is
earned by top wealth holders, who then save at higher rates, which pushes
wealth concentration up; this dynamic leads to rising capital-income concentration and contributes to even greater top income and wealth shares.
Rising wealth inequality is perhaps best understood as the ultimate
outcome of economic growth that leaves the middle class behind. But it is
also an important cause of income inequality. In part, it directly reinforces
itself because concentrated wealth leads to concentrated capital income. But
more importantly, it helps entrench a broader inequality of opportunity that
blocks the path to full economic participation for wide swaths of the potential U.S. labor force and innovation force.

Inequality of Opportunity
The traditional argument that inequality results from normal economic competition rests on the notion that competition for unequally distributed rewards encourages production. But when inequality has become
so entrenched that it passes across generations and limits opportunity, it

30  |  Chapter 1

narrows the pool of human capital that can compete. Such throttling of
opportunity is unambiguously bad for growth, preventing potential innovators from full economic participation and weighing on productivity growth.
Further, if entrenched interests are able to limit future competition either
by influencing the policymaking process or by abusing their market power,
dynamism in labor markets or firm entry can decrease. While some level of
income and wealth inequality can play a constructive role, the implications
of unevenly distributed opportunity are simpler—working the wrong way
for both equity and efficiency.
While inequality of opportunity is an international phenomenon, it is
especially important in the United States. Mishel et al. (2012), based on data
from Corak (2011), assembles a set of intergenerational earnings elasticities
across large advanced economies with similar incomes to the United States.
The intergenerational earnings elasticity reflects the extent to which the
earnings of parents and children are correlated—the higher the elasticity,
the less mobile the society. Such mobility can be understood as a measure
of the inequality of opportunity. If children at all income levels faced the
same set of opportunities, one might expect a lower elasticity. Among the 17
peer countries identified by Mishel, the United States ranks in the top half,
as shown in Figure 1-5. Other measures of mobility support the observation: Raj Chetty has found that a child born in the 1980s to parents in the
bottom 20 percent of the income distribution has only a 7.5 percent chance
of moving to the top 20 percent. A similar child has a 12 percent chance in
Denmark and a 13 percent chance in Canada (Chetty 2014).
It is important to understand the forms that this inequality of opportunity takes and to explore the institutional structures that entrench the
pattern. Three particular examples that the Council of Economic Advisers
has recently explored in a series of reports include the experience of children
in low-income families, inequities in the criminal justice system, and the
systemic challenges faced by women in the U.S. economy. The President
has a robust agenda to promote equality of opportunity for all Americans,
detailed extensively later in this chapter.

Children in Low-Income Families
Barriers to opportunity take many forms, but those that appear early
in life for children and youth are particularly costly to society, as their
impacts accumulate over many years, shaping adolescents and young adults
during their critical transition to adulthood beyond. Moreover, there is
evidence that in recent decades, family income has become more important in shaping children’s outcomes. Chapter 4 of this Report focuses on

the particular challenges facing children and the policies that can improve
outcomes for them.
Parents’ socioeconomic status can produce an inequality of opportunity via a number of channels. Financial expenditure is one obvious
pathway. As income inequality has grown, so has inequality in child-related
expenditures. Parents in the top income quintile now spend seven times
more on children’s materials and enrichment activities—such as books,
computers, summer camps, and music lessons—than families in the bottom income quintile, and other research suggests that this inequality in
expenditure has grown over time (Duncan and Murnane 2011). A family’s
socioeconomic status can also impact a child’s chances through housing
stability and neighborhood conditions, food security, and access to medical care, as well as in the types of activities that parents participate in with
their children. Sustained exposure to the toxic stresses of poverty during
childhood can prevent children from achieving their potential, exacerbating
later-life income inequality and limiting national economic growth.

Criminal Justice
The criminal justice system is plagued with inequalities of opportunity, both along racial lines, and along income lines in the form of monetary
payments such as fines, fees, and bail. The dramatic rise in incarceration
32  |  Chapter 1

over the past several decades has been distributed unequally, disproportionately impacting low-income households and minorities. In 1984, the majority of State and Federal prisoners were White; but by 2014, over 65 percent
of sentenced prisoners were minorities (Minor-Harper 1986; Carson 2015).
Even when there is little difference in the likelihood of committing a crime,
individuals of color are much more likely to be arrested. For example, an
African-American individual is nearly four times as likely as a White individual to be arrested for marijuana possession, even though individuals of
both races reported using marijuana at similar rates in 2010 (ACLU 2013).
Different rates of interaction with the criminal justice system by income and
race can create substantial barriers to economic success, limiting opportunity for many.
The expanding use of monetary penalties—fines, fees, and bails—also
disproportionately impact poor defendants and offenders who have fewer
resources available to manage criminal justice debt. Financial penalties also
serve as a regressive form of punishment as the same level of debt presents
an increasingly larger burden as one moves down the income scale. Such
systemic challenges limit the opportunities available to low-income families,
preventing them from full participation in our economy (CEA 2015a).

Women in the Economy
Over the last five decades, women have made enormous strides in the
U.S. labor market. Our economy is $2.0 trillion, or 13.5 percent, larger than
it would have been without women’s increased participation in the labor
force and hours worked since 1970 (CEA 2014).
Although the United States was initially a leader in bringing women
into the labor force, our progress has stalled somewhat over the past 20 or
30 years. In 1990, the United States ranked seventh in female prime-age (2554) labor force participation out of 24 advanced economies for which data
is available—but in 2014, the United States fell to 20th place (OECD 2015).
Part of the explanation may be that the United States lags behind many of
its peer countries in terms of pro-family policies like paid leave requirements
that ease the burden on working families.
Moreover, women in the labor force face a persistent wage gap. The
typical woman working full-time full-year earns 21 percent less than the
typical man. In addition, while the pay gap closed by 17 percentage points
between 1981 and 2001, it has remained flat since 2001. In the past two years,
some modest progress has been made, with the gap closing by 1.8 percentage
point from 2012 to 2013 and by an additional percentage point between 2013
and 2014. The wage gap has many causes and contributors, including gender

gaps in education and experience; differences in choices of occupation and
industry; decisions about family responsibilities; and discrimination.

The Interplay of the Forms of Inequality
These three forms of inequality discussed above are not conceptually
distinct phenomena—they closely affect one another. Wealth inequality is, in
some respects, an outcome of income inequality, as the saving of unequally
distributed income produces unequally distributed wealth. But inequality
of opportunity is in many ways both a cause and a result of income and
wealth inequality. Therefore, unequally distributed opportunities entrench
an unequal income distribution, and an unequal income distribution leads
to many of the inequities faced by low-income and low-wealth children.
The “Great Gatsby” curve, a term introduced by former CEA Chair
Alan Krueger, illustrates the relationship between income inequality and
inequality of opportunity. When plotted across counties or across countries,
Figures 1-6a and 1-6b shows that areas with more income inequality also
tend to have less mobility for children from low-income families. This relationship also holds across large advanced economies.
The Great Gatsby curve shows that inequality is correlated with lower
mobility, and one important transmission mechanism is the distribution of
opportunity. When disparities in education, training, social connection, and
the criminal justice system are distributed as unequally as overall wealth,
poorer families have a much harder time succeeding in the economy.

Sources of Inequality:
Competitive Markets and Economic Rents
Classical economics suggests that income inequality is a product of
competitive markets, with income differences reflecting pure productivity
differences. Under this view, inequality encourages growth by rewarding
the most productive labor and the highest-returning capital. But recently,
economists and commentators have suggested that much of the rise in
inequality can be explained by the rising importance of economic rents.
Recent work by the Council of Economic Advisers has focused on the influence of economic rents or their division in the labor market (CEA 2015c),
in the housing sector (Furman 2015a), in occupational licensing (Furman
2015b), and in the broader capital markets (Furman and Orszag 2015).
The long-term trend of rising inequality is sufficiently large that multiple forces are likely playing a part. While there is truth to the “competitive
markets” view that an unequal distribution of income compensation for

differences in productivity, there is also evidence of rents complicating the
income-productivity link. This Report considers each channel in turn.

The Competitive Channel
The traditional economic explanation of inequality is grounded in
competitive markets, wherein workers receive wages commensurate with
their productivity. According to this explanation, a combination of skillbiased technological change, a slowdown in the increase in educational
attainment, and globalization have increased the demand for highly skilled
workers at the same time that their relative supply has not kept pace—
resulting in higher wages for these high-productivity workers and greater
inequality.

Skill-Biased Technological Change
Many economists have pointed to the role of technology in increasing inequality (Autor 2010). This argument asserts that technology can
most readily replace labor in tasks that are easily automated, which tend
to involve routine tasks that place them in the middle of the skill and wage
distributions. Over time, employment moves to both the lower and higher
ends of the occupational skill ranking, as shown in Figure 1-7, where occupations are ranked by average wage as a proxy for skill. While technology is
a better replacement for tasks that are easy to routinize, it complements the
abilities of highly skilled workers and improves their productivity, thereby
increasing their earnings and employment opportunities. Lower-skilled
workers are not necessarily made more productive, but neither are they
easily replaced, as their jobs often include interpersonal interactions and
variable situations that are difficult to automate. Taken together, this view
of the role of technology points to both rising inequality and rising job
polarization.
Educational Attainment
The increase in skill-biased technological change has been compounded by a slowdown in the rate of increase in educational attainment.
Schooling attainment rose for much of the 20th century, in part due to
measures like the G.I. Bill, the expansion of high schools and community
colleges, and greater educational attainment by women. However, growth
in years of schooling slowed substantially around 1980. The rate of growth
in the college-educated population fell by almost 60 percent, from 3.9 percent a year between 1960 and 1980 to 2.3 percent per year between 1980
and 2005, according to estimates by Lawrence Katz and Claudia Goldin.
While the pool of skilled workers is still growing, in recent decades it has

grown at a slower rate than has the demand for these workers, increasing
the wage premium that more educated workers command and thus raising
inequality.

Globalization
Other economists have pointed to the rapid rise in globalization that
has occurred since the 1980s as a potential explanation for growing inequality within the United States, especially the expansion of trade with China
since 2000. (Greater globalization also coincided with a shift in national
income shares from labor to capital, a worldwide phenomenon.) Economic
theory predicts that such trade may have some effect on wages for lowskilled workers in the United States who now face more competition from
low-skilled Chinese workers, while reducing wages for high-skilled workers in China who now face more competition from high-skilled American
workers. But some evidence militates in the other direction. For example,
the returns to education have increased in a wide range of countries over
the last several decades, including many relatively poor countries. This
suggests either that some other more-subtle globalization explanation is
operative or, alternatively, that the technology/education explanations are
even more important than the globalization explanation.

Inclusive Growth in the United States  |  37

To some extent, some of these forces—like skill-biased technological
change and globalization—reflect the type of desirable economic progress
that promotes productivity growth. But that competitive channel works
best when the competition is open to the broadest pool of potential labor
and investable capital. Public policy is therefore critical to ensuring that the
competitive channel works well, in part by providing a cushion for those disadvantaged by the system—such as providing job retraining, unemployment
insurance, robust Social Security, access to health care, and other policies for
which the President has advocated. But government also has an important
role in reducing the inequality of opportunity that creates barriers to success
for some groups and thus limits the pool of workers who can successfully
compete in the labor market.
As important as these forces are, the competitive channel does not
appear to explain the full rise in income inequality in recent decades.
Indeed, as mentioned earlier, there is evidence that an especially unproductive element is at work—the rising influence of economic rents and their
distribution.

The Rents Channel
Many economists have recently advanced an explanation of inequality
grounded in the importance of economic rents—the notion that investors
or highly compensated workers are receiving more income than they would
require to undertake their production or work. Classic examples of such
rents include monopoly profits and the unearned benefits of preferential
government regulation. Rents can result from abuses of market power
and tend to encourage “rent-seeking behavior,” the unproductive use of
resources to capture such rewards.
According to this view, the unequal distribution of these rents—rather
than the conventional explanation that inequality reflects only actual differences in worker productivity or the allocation of capital—is an important
cause of rising income inequality. To the degree that this interpretation is
correct, it suggests that it is possible to reduce inequality without hurting
efficiency by changing how the rents are divided or even while increasing
efficiency by acting to reduce these rents. There is relatively little academic
literature on this question and data are scarce since rents cannot be directly
observed, but considerable evidence appears to support the notion that rents
are exacerbating inequality.
It is important to note that not all economic rents are undesirable.
For example, in a perfectly competitive market, the price settles at a level
below that which some buyers would be willing to pay and above that which
some sellers would be willing to accept. The rents collected by these buyers
38  |  Chapter 1

and sellers—consumer and producer surplus—are widely considered one of
the chief benefits of market competition. In addition, temporary monopoly
power that guarantees rents for a firm can be an incentive for additional
innovation—one of the goals of our patent system. Nevertheless, growing
rents, the increasingly unequal division of rents between workers and firms,
and rent-seeking behavior are often highly problematic and appear to have
become more so in recent decades (Furman and Orszag 2015).

The Division of Rents in Wage Negotiations: Declining Unionization
and the Minimum Wage
Whenever a firm hires a worker, the difference between the highest
wage the firm would pay and the lowest wage the worker would accept is the
surplus created by the job match—an economic rent. The division of that
rent between firm and work depends on their relative bargaining power. As
markets grow concentrated and certain forms of labor are commoditized,
the balance of bargaining power leans toward the firm. Unionization and
collective bargaining—along with policies like the minimum wage—help
level the playing field, concentrating labor and encouraging the firm to share
those rents with labor. This process traditionally helped bolster the wages of
lower- and middle-wage workers, thereby reducing inequality.
But union membership has declined consistently since the 1970s, as
shown in Figure 1-8. Approximately a quarter of all U.S. workers belonged to
a union in 1955 but, by 2014, union membership had dropped to just below
10 percent of total employment, roughly the same level as the mid-1930s. In
some states, just 3 percent of workers belong to unions (CEA 2015c).
Research suggests that declining unionization accounts for between
a fifth and a third of the increase in inequality since the 1970s (Western
and Rosenfeld 2011). Other research shows that union workers have higher
wages than their nonunion counterparts, with unions raising wages by up
to 25 percent for their workers compared with similar nonunion workers
(Boskin 1972). Unions also increase the likelihood workers have access to
benefits and work under safe conditions.
Of course, other specific policies can help promote wage growth by
affecting the division of economic rents. The minimum wage is one such
policy, geared to those workers with the very-least bargaining power. A
minimum wage protects some workers from having their lack of bargaining
power exploited by firms in the wage negotiation, helping direct some of the
rents from their job match to the workers themselves. But the real value of
the minimum wage has declined [20] percent over the past three decades,
losing its ability to protect workers in parallel with declining unionization.

Greater support for collective bargaining and the minimum wage are
both policies that can help address the increasingly unequal division of economic rents, promoting stronger wage growth and reduced inequality—and
to the degree that such policies are about changing the divisions of rents,
they need not reduce efficiency. In some respects, like improving worker’s
voice and motivation, such policies can actually boost efficiency.

Some Evidence for the Growth of Aggregate Rents
The challenge is not just that the division of rents is changing based on
comparative bargaining power. Moreover, the economic structure appears
to be generating greater rents and tilting these toward profits and profitable
firms.
Corporate Profits and Interest Rates
One important piece of evidence that rents are on the rise is the
divergence of rising corporate profits and declining real interest rates. In
the absence of economic rents, corporate profits should generally follow the
path of interest rates, which reflect the prevailing return to capital in the
economy. But over the past three decades, corporate profits have risen as
interest rates have fallen, as shown in Figure 1-9. This suggests that some
corporate profits could reflect an increase in the economic rents collected by
corporations, not a “pure” return to capital. Of course, this divergence can

be affected by other factors such as credit risk, but such factors are unlikely
to explain the full gap.
Market Concentration and the Distribution of Profits
Another piece of evidence for the rising importance of rents is
increased market concentration across a number of industries. Table 1-2
shows that the share of revenue earned by the largest firms increased across
most industries between 1997 and 2007. This observation complements a
range of studies that find increasing concentration in air travel, telecommunications, banking, food-processing, and other sectors of the economy.
Increased concentration may play a role in the strikingly large and
growing disparity in return to invested capital across major corporations
(Furman and Orszag 2015). As shown in Figure 1-10, the returns earned by
firms at the 90th percentile are now more than six times larger than those of
the median firm, up from less than three times larger in 1990.
Occupational Licensing
There is also evidence of increased rent-seeking in the requirement of
a government-issued license to be employed in certain professions (“occupational licensing”). As documented in Kleiner and Krueger (2013), the share
of the U.S. workforce covered by state licensing laws grew five-fold in the

second half of the 20th century, from less than 5 percent in the early 1950s to
25 percent by 2008, as shown in Figure 1-11. Although state licenses account
for the bulk of licensing, the addition of locally and Federally licensed
occupations further raises the share of the workforce that is licensed to 29
percent.
While licensing can play an important role in protecting consumer
health and safety, there is evidence that some licensing requirements create
economic rents for licensed practitioners at the expense of excluded workers and consumers—increasing inefficiency and potentially also increasing
inequality. First, the employment barriers created by licensing raise wages
for those who are successful in gaining entry to a licensed occupation by
restricting employment in the licensed profession and lowering wages
for excluded workers. Estimates find that unlicensed workers earn 10- to
15-percent lower wages than licensed workers with similar levels of education, training, and experience (Kleiner and Krueger 2010). Second, research
finds that more restrictive licensing laws lead to higher prices for goods
and services, in many cases for lower-income households, while the quality,
health and safety benefits do not always materialize (Kleiner 2015). Finally,
some state-specific licensing requirements create unnecessary barriers to
entry for out-of-state licensed practitioners, reducing mobility across state
lines (Johnson and Kleiner 2014).
Inclusive Growth in the United States  |  43

Housing and Land-Use Restrictions
There is evidence that land-use regulation may also play a role in the
presence of increased economic rents. Such regulation in the housing market
can serve legitimate, welfare-enhancing purposes, such as restrictions that
prohibit industrial activities from occurring alongside or within residential
neighborhoods or limitations on the size of a dwelling due to a fragile local
water supply. But when excessive and primarily geared toward protecting
the interests of current landowners—including their property values—landuse regulations decrease housing affordability and reduce nationwide productivity and growth. These are impacts detailed in Chapters 2 and 6 of this
Report, respectively. The presence of rents in the housing market, moreover,
may also restrict labor mobility and exacerbate inequality.
One main indication that land-use regulation gives rise to economic
rents is that, in the aggregate, real house prices are higher than real construction costs, and this differential has increased since at least the early 1980s,
as shown in Figure 1-12. In fact, Glaeser, Gyourko, and Saks (2005) find
that more stringent land-use regulations have driven house price appreciation in excess of construction costs since 1970, before which time quality
improvements actually drove much of the price increases. Further, in a large
and growing set of U.S. cities—including major population centers such as
New York and Los Angeles and high-productivity cities like San Francisco—
home prices are usually at least 40 percent above construction costs. (Glaeser
and Gyourko 2003). In addition, rental payments in the housing market in
these areas often rise faster than wages.

The Interplay of Inequality and Growth
The relationship between inequality and growth continues to be the
subject of much debate in the economics literature. The traditional finding for canonical policy responses to inequality, like progressive taxation
and income support for low-income households, is that there is a tradeoff
between equity and efficiency, the famous “leaky bucket” coined by Arthur
Okun (1975). There has also been a long-standing macroeconomic debate
about the consequences of inequality, with one traditional view being that
more inequality leads to more savings by high-income households and thus
a higher level of output (Duesenberry 1949).
The current theory and evidence at both a micro and macro level is
considerably more ambiguous than these traditional views and suggests a
number of mechanisms by which inequality can be harmful to growth. As
discussed above, one clear-cut example is that to the degree that inequality is

generated by anti-competitive rents, then fostering greater competition has
the potential to improve both equity and efficiency simultaneously.
But even with respect to inequality that stems from competitive markets, the relationship between such inequality and output is unclear. While
there are no doubt respects in which such inequality can help motivate additional innovation and growth, a range of new research has also emphasized
that there are a number of ways through which inequality may in fact constrain economic growth. This literature starts from the observation that the
traditional emphasis on the quantity of capital, even if true, is dwarfed by the
importance of the quality of capital, technology, and entrepreneurship. In
particular, this approach emphasizes a number of ways by which inequality
could harm growth: (1) by reducing access to the education necessary for the
full population to reach its full potential; (2) by reducing entrepreneurship
and risk-taking; (3) by undermining the trust necessary for a decentralized
market economy and by increasing monitoring costs; and (4) by leading
to increased political instability, growth-reducing policies, and uncertainty
(Ostry, Berg, and Tsangarides 2014).
In keeping with this, much recent microeconomic evidence finds
important exceptions to the “leaky bucket.” For example, as discussed in
Chapter 4, a number of anti-poverty programs focused on children have

Inclusive Growth in the United States  |  45

been shown to increase incomes in later life, illustrating the importance of
the educational channel between inequality and growth.
It is impossible to have the same degree of confidence about causation
at the macroeconomic level as at the microeconomic level. There are no
comparable natural experiments and the causality between inequality and
growth clearly runs in both directions. Nevertheless, the fact that several
recent papers have found that inequality is harmful to growth suggests—at
a minimum—that it is unlikely that there is a substantial tradeoff between
equality and growth.
For example, cross-country analysis from Jonathan Ostry, Andrew
Berg and Charalambos Tsangarides at the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) provides better evidence of the harm done by inequality and the lack
of harm done by progressive policies. The IMF study finds that inequality decreases both the magnitude and sustainability of growth and that
progressive redistributive policies alone are neutral for the magnitude and
sustainability of growth (with a small caveat that very large amounts of
redistribution—those policies that redistribute above the 75th percentile of
income—could have a small negative effect on growth).
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) also found associations between higher inequality and reduced
growth across OECD member countries (Cingano 2014). The OECD
focused on inequality of opportunity, particularly disparities in education, as
the chief transmission mechanism of inequality’s restraint on growth.
Ultimately, the link between growth and inequality at an aggregate
level is ambiguous, not admitting a single direction for all countries at all
times and all types of inequality. Rather, the most important question is the
one that policymakers face when they have the opportunity to address these
trends on the margins: What are the policies that address inequality in a
relatively efficient manner?

Policies to Promote Inclusive Growth
As economists’ understanding of the relationship between growth and
inequality evolves, it is critical to choose economic policies that can unleash
growth in an inclusive manner along with those policies that can reduce
inequality in an efficient manner. Analysis of the various forms and sources
of inequality in the United States can help to elucidate the mechanisms by
which certain pro-growth policies can reduce inequality through either the
competitive channel or the rents channel. Policies that promote inclusive
growth can be grouped in four categories: those that strengthen aggregate
demand in general; those that make the competitive channel work better by

46  |  Chapter 1

promoting equality of opportunity; those that reduce unproductive inequality by reducing inefficient rents and rent-seeking behavior; and those that
help better protect workers and their families from the consequences of
inequality—while in many cases also serving as a springboard for upward
mobility. The President’s agenda for middle-class economics includes a
range of policies along each of these dimensions.

Strengthening Aggregate Demand
When an economy operates below its full potential, pro-growth policies that help to close the output gap naturally combat inequality. Indeed,
unemployment or sub-optimal employment is a form of inequality itself,
resulting in zero or insufficient labor earnings for a subset of workers. The
same macroeconomic policies usually employed to boost growth and return
the economy to full employment can unambiguously reduce this cyclical
form of income inequality.
Aggressive demand management strategies implemented by the
United States can, in this context, also be seen as distributional policies. Part
of the U.S. response to the global financial crisis involved massive support to
low-income households via the fiscal expansion in the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and extended unemployment insurance,
among other programs. While fiscal expansion and accommodative monetary policy worked to boost aggregate incomes, their principal goal was the
restoration of income to those who found themselves out of work during
the crisis.
Additionally, a lower unemployment rate—one important effect of
boosting aggregate demand—can help increase wages and draw marginalized workers back into the labor force. Rising labor demand and higher
wages can also encourage workers to upgrade their skills and education.
Therefore, a tight labor market can have substantial advantages for workers—particularly those at the bottom of the economic ladder—making a
strong economy an important tool for fighting inequality.
Moreover, weak aggregate demand can have long-lasting effects.
Many unemployed workers receive lower incomes for years to come, even
after finding a job; the other side of these potentially long-lasting reductions
in earnings is the possibility of long-run scarring in the economy and persistently lower output in the years after a recession ends. That is why continuing to support stronger growth, a low unemployment rate, and expanded
labor force participation remains a critical goal of Administration policy.
The need for such policies was closely aligned across countries in the
immediate wake of the recent crisis. Today, many advanced economies find
themselves at different stages of the business cycle. However, as sub-par
Inclusive Growth in the United States  |  47

wage growth manifests itself as a global phenomenon, it is clear that most of
the industrialized world remains below full employment, underscoring the
continued need for appropriate demand-management strategies.

Promoting Equality of Opportunity
The competitive channel of inequality works best when that competition is open to the largest pool of potential labor and investable capital—so
it depends upon equality of opportunity that allows all Americans to participate in the economy to their full potential. Education and training are critical in this respect. To that end, the President put forward a plan to increase
access to child care for working families while investing billions of dollars in
quality early learning and preschool programs to help our youngest learners
succeed—especially those from low-income families. The Administration
has provided unprecedented resources and worked with business leaders,
state and local governments, and others to align job training programs with
labor market demand—and the President signed the bipartisan Workforce
Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), the first legislative reform of
Federal job training programs in nearly 15 years, which will improve business engagement, accountability, access, and alignment across job training, employment service, and adult education programs. Moreover, the
President continues to lead a movement to make community college free
for responsible students. All of these steps help increase the supply of skilled
workers, allowing more people to take advantage of the returns to skills
while also increasing the relative demand for unskilled workers, driving up
their wages and reducing the dispersion of incomes.
In addition, an important element of opportunity is giving everyone
the opportunity to participate in the workforce if they choose to and it makes
sense given their family situation. The President supports a range of policies
to boost labor force participation, including promoting access to paid leave
and paid sick days to help encourage Americans to join the labor force;
promoting greater access to high-quality child care; reforming taxes to make
work more attractive for secondary earners; and helping provide training
programs and other assistance finding jobs.

Reducing Market Power Concentration and Rent-Seeking Behavior
To the degree that rising aggregate rents stemming from growing
market power are contributing to increased inequality, then changing the
balance of that power or fostering more competitive markets will increase
efficiency while reducing inequality. Policies like a minimum wage and
greater support for collective bargaining can help level the playing field for
workers in negotiations with employers. Because such policies only change
48  |  Chapter 1

the division of rents, they can reduce inequality without necessarily reducing overall welfare. In fact, when appropriately tailored, they can foster the
previously discussed growth benefits of a better-paid workforce like greater
access to education and increased entrepreneurship.
Heightened antitrust enforcement, rationalizing licensing requirements for employment, reducing zoning and other land use restrictions, and
appropriately balancing intellectual property regimes, all can help reduce
excessive rents. Firms with extensive market power can take many anticompetitive actions that generate inefficient rents. Often, there are existing
regulations prohibiting such behavior. A robust enforcement regime for
the regulations that fight rent-seeking can therefore improve efficiency and
inequality at the same time.
Finally, to the degree that rent-seeking warps regulations, policymakers should reduce the ability of people or corporations to seek rents successfully through political reforms and other steps to reduce the influence of
regulatory lobbying. Much like the first two channels, policies that reduce
these rents can also increase efficiency while reducing inequality.

Protecting Families Against the Consequences of Inequality While
Fostering Mobility
A progressive tax system combined with important benefits that exist
today—like unemployment insurance and the Affordable Care Act—and
new proposals the President has made, like wage insurance, can help both
reduce inequality and protect the people who get an unlucky draw in a given
year or over time. In many cases, such policies do not just affect after-tax
incomes, but also help increase before-tax incomes over time. The Earned
Income Tax Credit (EITC), for example, has been shown to increase labor
force participation by single mothers, raising their earnings and their aftertax income (Liebman 1998).
Moreover, a growing body of economic research has helped confirm
that programs to support low-income families can not only strengthen
the position of the families themselves, but also have important benefits
for long-term productivity (Brown, Kowalski, and Lurie, 2015; Hoynes,
Schanzenbach, and Almond, 2012; Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff, 2011).
Indeed, the link between growth and equality is especially apparent at the
lower end of the income distribution where the unequal distribution of
opportunity is most important.
Economists have evaluated the long-term benefits of historical
government programs targeted toward low-income families in the United
States. Compared with similar children who received no support, children
from families who received temporary income support at the start of the
Inclusive Growth in the United States  |  49

20th century saw higher wages, more education, and lower mortality—with
benefits from a few years of income support lasting for 80 years or more
(Aizer, Eli, and Ferrie, 2014). The U.S. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program—formerly known as the Food Stamp Program; the EITC, one of
the government’s largest tools to reduce child poverty; and Medicaid, the
health program for low-income Americans, have all been shown to have
similar benefits (CEA 2015b).
Greater education, lower mortality, and lower crime rates do not just
benefit the affected individual, but also support productivity and potential
growth in the aggregate. Many of these policies would also strengthen labor
force participation. When the public sector makes important investments
in supporting the most disadvantaged families, there are clear benefits to
aggregate growth.

Conclusion:
The 2016 Economic Report of the President
Middle-class incomes are driven by productivity growth, labor force
participation, and the equality of outcomes. As the U.S. economy moves
beyond the recovery from the financial crisis, our policy stance should focus
on promoting each of those factors to foster inclusive growth. This year’s
Economic Report of the President considers several elements of the inclusive
growth agenda. Chapter 2 begins by reviewing the United States’ macroeconomic progress in 2015 and considering the outlook for the years to come,
and Chapter 3 focuses on the United States’ progress in a global context.
Chapter 4 focuses on one especially important element of the inequality of
opportunity discussed in this chapter—the particular economic challenges
low-income children face. Chapters 5 and 6 consider two key elements
of productivity growth on which American businesses and policymakers
should focus even more closely: technological innovation and infrastructure
investment. Finally, Chapter 7 concludes with a retrospective look at the
institutional structure and history of the President’s Council of Economic
Advisers on its 70th anniversary.

THE YEAR IN REVIEW AND
THE YEARS AHEAD

T

he U.S. economy continued to grow in 2015, as the recovery extended
into its seventh year with widespread growth in domestic demand,
strong gains in labor markets and real wages, and low inflation. Real gross
domestic product (GDP) increased 1.8 percent during the four quarters of
the year, down from 2.5-percent growth during 2013 and 2014. In 2015,
residential investment led the growth in demand, while consumer spending
again rose solidly. Business fixed investment growth slowed from earlier
in the recovery and increased at about the same pace as real GDP. Weak
growth among our foreign trading partners restrained exports, and government purchases increased modestly after falling for most of the preceding
five years.
Over the course of 2015, the economy added 2.7 million jobs, completing the strongest two years of job growth since 1999. In December,
private-sector employment had grown for 70 consecutive months, the longest stretch of uninterrupted job gains on record, with a total of 13.8 million
jobs added. During 2015, nonfarm job growth averaged 228,000 a month, a
somewhat more moderate pace than during 2014, but similar to the strong
pace of the three preceding years. The unemployment rate fell 0.6 percentage
point during the 12 months through December, after falling a percentage
point a year, on average, during the three preceding years (Figure 2-1).
Inflation remained low with consumer price inflation (CPI) at only 0.7
percent during the 12 months of 2015, reflecting a sharp decline in oil prices.
Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, increased 2.1 percent, above the
year-earlier rate of 1.6 percent. Real average hourly earnings of production
and nonsupervisory workers rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months of 2015, as
nominal wage growth exceeded price inflation.
Challenges remain for 2016, including uncertain prospects for global
growth, constraints posed by slowing trend growth in the labor force due to
demographic shifts, and the yet incomplete labor market recovery. Turmoil

in stock markets around the world, and further sharp declines in oil prices in
early 2016, underscore the risks facing the U.S. economy; in particular, in the
energy-producing and export-intensive sectors. And yet, the labor market
continues to recover with the unemployment rate declining to 4.9 percent
in January 2016, its lowest level since February 2008.
The economic recovery in recent years has differed across labor and
output measures. The labor market continued to strengthen and, by the
end of 2015, the unemployment rate had fallen to half its recessionary peak,
but real output growth, at 1.8 percent during the four quarters of 2015, was
slower than its pace in recent years. As a consequence, labor productivity—measured as real output-per-hour—in the nonfarm sector has grown
more slowly than its long-term trend thus far during this business cycle. The
labor force participation rate has fallen largely due to the baby-boom cohorts
moving into retirement, but some of the decline represents the continuation
of the decades-long downward trend in the participation of prime-age males
as well as the decline in participation of prime-age females since 2000.
While real GDP grew moderately during 2015, the quarterly pace of
economic growth was uneven. First-quarter growth (0.6-percent annual
rate) was held down by a labor dispute at the West coast ports and unusually

52  |  Chapter 2

cold weather.1 The economy rebounded in the second quarter, growing at a
3.9-percent annual rate followed by more steady growth of 2.0 percent in the
third quarter. Growth slowed again in the fourth quarter to 0.7 percent at an
annual rate, weighed down by declines in inventory investment and exports.
The price of oil, as measured by the spot price of European light crude
oil from the North Sea (known as Brent), fell to $37 per barrel at the end of
December 2015, about a third of its level in June 2014 (Figure 2-2).
The oil-price decline from mid-2014 to the end of 2015 reflected both
increased global supply of oil, including rising production in the United
States, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq, and slower global economic growth. It is difficult to precisely separate the role of supply and demand, but the comparison
to non-energy commodity prices highlights the mix of factors affecting oil
prices. Non-energy commodity prices also declined over this period—a sign
of weakening global demand. But the non-energy commodity price decline
of about 25 percent was considerably less than the about 65-percent decline
in oil prices, pointing to the role of oil supply in lowering prices. Lower oil
prices affect the U.S. economy through numerous channels (CEA 2014).
On balance, CEA estimates that lower oil prices directly boosted real GDP
growth by 0.2 percentage point during 2015, despite the adverse impacts on
domestic energy producers and manufacturers that sell to the energy sector
(see Box 2-1). Relatedly, the decline in oil prices noticeably held down price
inflation and supported real income growth in 2015. Oil and commodity
prices continued to fall sharply in early 2016 and are likely to continue to
affect consumers and energy producers.
Foreign growth slowed markedly in 2015, particularly in China and
other emerging-market economies, with the International Monetary Fund’s
(IMF) October 2015 report estimating that world year-over-year growth was
3.1 percent in 2015, the slowest rate of global growth since 2009 (see Chapter
3 for more discussion). Spillovers from the slowing pace of China’s growth
affected many commodity-exporting countries. Slowing foreign growth
sharply reduced U.S. exports, as the growth rate of our trade partners was
0.4 percentage points lower during the four quarters ending in 2015:Q3 (the
latest available data) than during the year earlier period.

1 Three snowstorms occurred during 2015:Q1 that were so severe that the National Climate
Data Center rated them in the Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale (NESIS). NESIS scores are a
function of the area affected by the snowstorm, the amount of snow, and the number of people
living in the path of the storm (Kocin and Uccellini 2004). During the 59 years on record,
2015:Q1 was only the fourth time that a quarter was impacted by three or more NESIS-rated
storms.

Policy Developments
Fiscal Policy
Fiscal restraint in the United States continued in fiscal year (FY) 2015
with the Federal budget deficit falling 0.3 percentage point to 2.5 percent
of GDP, the lowest level since 2007 and below the average over the last 40
years. The deficit as a share of GDP has fallen by about three-fourths since
2009, the most rapid six-year deficit reduction since the demobilization
after World War II (Figure 2-3). The additional deficit reduction in 2015
was through automatic stabilizers, such as the increase in tax collections as
income rises, and was much less severe than the 1.9 percentage point a year
decline in the deficit-to-GDP ratio during the three preceding years when
changes in tax or spending policy were the primary driver.
The two-year Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, passed in December
2013, helped provide fiscal-policy stability during FY 2014 and FY 2015.
Since that time, a series of agreements—most recently the Bipartisan Budget
Act of 2015—have avoided a Federal shutdown, partly relieved automatic
Federal spending cuts known as sequestration, and relaxed the Federal debt
limit. Government purchases, including consumption and gross investment,
at the Federal as well as State and local levels, added modestly to overall
54  |  Chapter 2

Box 2-1: Impact of Oil Price Declines on Spending and Production
The United States is a net importer of oil, so a decline in oil prices
is generally expected to boost domestic real income and lower incomes
in countries that are net exporters of oil, such as Saudi Arabia and Russia.
Yet, U.S. net oil imports have fallen 63 percent in the last ten years due
to both greater domestic production and lower consumption, so the U.S.
economy is less sensitive to oil price movements today than in the past.
Moreover, the direct impact of oil price changes on energy consumers
and energy producers moves in opposite directions. The overall impact
of oil price changes also depends on the sources of those price changes.1
For example, if oil prices fall due to lower demand in a weakening global
economy, this is likely to also coincide with a reduction in U.S. GDP
growth, but it would be incorrect to infer that the oil price decline itself
hurt U.S. GDP growth. In contrast, if the price of oil falls due to an
increase in oil supply, such as from technological advances in oil extraction or improving geopolitical conditions in oil producing countries,
lower oil prices would tend to increase U.S. GDP. This box analyzes the
direct impact of the fall in the price of oil from mid-2014 to late 2015 on
the U.S. economy, an exercise that is most informative when the oil price
declines are driven primarily by an increase in oil supply.
Overall, CEA estimates, as shown in Table 2-i, that the decline
in oil prices had the direct impact of boosting real GDP growth by 0.1
percentage point during 2014 and 0.2 percentage point during 2015.
Considerable uncertainty surrounds these estimates of the direct effects
of the oil price decline, and moreover, these estimates exclude indirect
effects.
The boost to output and consumption from lower oil prices is
largely due to the lower cost of imported oil. U.S. net imports of petroTable 2-i

leum and products averaged 1.8 billion barrels per year in 2014 and
2015, so each $10 per barrel decline in the price of imports saved the
U.S. economy about $18 billion per year, or about 0.1 percent of nominal
GDP. In 2015 as a whole, the United States spent about $100 billion less
on net imported oil than if prices had stayed at their mid-2014 level. In
total, the net transfer of income to the United States depends on how
much oil prices decline and how long those low prices persist. These
savings are spread across all oil-using sectors, especially consumers for
whom lower gasoline prices freed up income for other purchases. It
may take time for consumers to make those additional purchases, so the
timing of the additional spending may lag the declines in oil prices. In
fact, the personal saving rate moved up around the start of 2015 when
oil prices declined rapidly, but then consumer spending grew strongly
in the middle of the year. As oil prices declined sharply in late 2015, the
personal saving rate moved up back up in the fourth quarter, suggesting
some delay again in the consumption response. CEA estimates that
assuming all the savings on imported oil were spent within the year then
they would add 0.5 percentage point to GDP growth in 2015 (shown
in the “Consumption” line in Table 2-i). This direct estimate does not
include additional effects like the multiplier associated with additional
economic activity, the boost to consumer confidence, and the potential
benefits of lower inflation for monetary policy management.

Roughly speaking, the decline in the price of domestically-produced
oil sold to U.S. consumers has largely offsetting effects for American oil
producers and consumers—although differences in how consumers and
producers adjust to lower oil prices may differ enough for aggregate
impacts from this channel to appear over shorter horizons. Thus, the
primary boost to overall output comes from imported oil. However, the
share of imported oil has declined as domestic production increased and
domestic oil use fell, so the overall boost to the U.S. economy from this
oil price decline is smaller than would have been the case historically.
Changes in oil prices also affect the amount of investment done
by oil firms. Oil drilling and exploration dropped sharply in 2015 as
shown in Figure 2-i, and these declines weighed down U.S. investment
(and GDP) and are not reflected in the net-import savings discussed
above. Oil drilling and exploration, as measured by the number of oil
rigs in operation, peaked in September 2014 and dropped 62 percent by
December 2015. In addition, investment in oil and mining equipment
fell 40 percent during 2015. As shown in the “Drilling” line in Table 2-i,
the cutback in this investment reduced real GDP growth by 0.3 percentage point in 2015, assuming that investment growth in the drilling sector
would have been unchanged if the price had not fallen. In addition, this
direct estimate excludes potential additional economic costs, including the multiplier effect and also spillovers from the stresses in credit
markets associated with increased default risks of oil companies. On the

other hand, oil-using industries benefit from lower oil prices and might
increase investment, an effect that is also not captured here.
The current direct estimate of a 0.2 percentage point increase in
GDP growth in 2015 is well below the 1 percentage point boost implied
by the econometric model used in earlier CEA analysis (CEA 2014).2
One explanation for the difference is that the econometric models, which
are estimated off past oil price changes, also pick up the indirect effects
on demand described above. Moreover, any model which assumes a
linear relationship between oil prices and output may be less applicable
when oil prices fall below production costs. Price declines large enough
to cause bankruptcies or large equity price declines in the energy sector
could have additional negative impacts. Thinking more broadly about
previous historical episodes, another explanation for the smaller boost to
GDP from this oil price decline is that the United States now consumes
less oil than it did in 1997 (CEA 2015c for an extensive discussion)
and produces 4 million barrels a day more than in 2005, so that net oil
imports are down (see Figure 2-ii). As a result, the boost to consumption
from cheaper imported oil is smaller than in the past, and the impact
on oil-sector investment is larger. Moreover, new technologies, such as
hydraulic fracturing (fracking), may make investment even more sensitive to oil price changes. By this same logic the U.S. economy will be
more resilient to possible future increases in the price of oil.

a 10-percent oil price change depending on the import share of oil. The lower end of the
range, cited here, is consistent with the current import share.

fiscal policy was less restrictive in FY 2015. The Consolidated and Further
Continuing Appropriations Act, signed into law in December 2014, made
the fiscal environment through the end of FY 2015 more stable (that is, compared with a string of short-term continuing resolutions). The Temporary
Debt Limit Extension Act, signed in February 2014, suspended the debt
ceiling through March 2015. When the Federal debt reached its limit on
March 16, 2015, the U.S. Treasury resorted to “extraordinary measures” to
function through October without exceeding the debt limit. As the new fiscal
year approached on October 1 and budget negotiations began in Congress,

there was some risk of a government shutdown, but a continuing resolution
extended spending (at static levels) through December 11. Negotiations
continued during the period covered by the continuing resolution, eventually resulting in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 signed on November 2.
That agreement suspended the debt ceiling again through March 15, 2017
and lifted sequester spending caps by $50 billion in FY 2016 and by $30 billion in FY 2017 (about 0.3 and 0.2 percent of GDP, respectively) split equally
between defense and nondefense spending. The passage of the Consolidated
Appropriations Act of 2016 in December 2015 set programmatic spending
levels consistent with the new caps established by the budget agreement,
including increases in investment in research and development, early education, and infrastructure. December legislation also made permanent a
number of expiring tax provisions, including credits for research and development, small businesses, and low-income households. Absent any further
changes in policy, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to rise steadily over the
10-year budget window, increasing from 76.5 percent of GDP at the end of
FY 2016 to 87.6 percent at the end of FY 2026. The policies proposed in the
President’s Budget would stabilize the debt and put it on a declining path
through 2025 when it reaches 75.2 percent of GDP.
State and Local. State and local government purchases (consumption plus gross investment) contributed positively, but weakly, to real GDP
growth in 2015 for the second consecutive year following four years of
negative contributions. The State and local share of nominal GDP fell from
its historical peak of 13.0 percent in 2009 to 10.9 percent in 2015, a level not
seen since the late 1980s as State and local governments cut their purchases
in the face of budget pressures (Box 2-2).
In 2015, State and local government purchases were about 60-percent
larger than Federal purchases and four times larger than Federal nondefense
purchases (Figure 2-5). In a broad view of fiscal policy, changes in State and
local purchases can be as important as changes in Federal purchases.

Monetary Policy
In December 2015, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)
increased the target range for the federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage point,
ending seven years at its effective lower bound, and maintained that range
in January of this year. The FOMC’s decision to tighten monetary policy
was based on its judgment that labor markets had improved considerably
and that it was reasonably confident that inflation would move up over the
medium term to its 2-percent objective. When it raised the federal funds
rate—an event widely referred to as “lift off”—the FOMC stated that it
“expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant

Box 2-2: Challenges in the State and Local Sector
During the current expansion, growth in State and local purchases
has been the weakest of any business-cycle recovery in the post-World
War II period (Figure 2-iii). During the four quarters of 2010, State and
local purchases subtracted 0.5 percentage point from GDP growth, and
then subtracted about another 0.3 percentage point in both 2011 and
2012. Spending in this sector stabilized in 2013 and added modestly to
GDP growth in 2014 and 2015. State and local governments also cut jobs
early in the recovery. Beginning in 2013, though, this trend began to shift.
State and local governments have added 210,000 jobs since January 2013.
Even so, employment in this sector remains 528,000 below its previous
high in 2008, with about 40 percent of this net job loss in educational
services. The 1.4-percent decline in education employment exceeded the
0.9-percent decline in the school-age population (ages 5 to 19) over the
2008-14 period. This mismatch implies a rising student-teacher ratio.

Economic Research; CEA calculations.

Despite some recovery in 2015, there are still factors likely to
restrain State and local spending growth. State and local governments
continue to spend more than they collect in revenues and their aggregate deficit during the first three quarters of 2015 amounted to nearly
1 percent of nominal GDP. This deficit has shrunk, however, during
the recovery (Figure 2-iv). During 2015, State and local expenditures
(including transfers and interest payments, as well as purchases) were
roughly flat at about 14 percent of GDP, and revenues held at about

62  |  Chapter 2

13 percent of GDP. Until 1990, State and local governments only ran
deficits during recessions.1 Since then, State and local governments have
frequently run deficits.
Unfunded pension obligations place a heavy burden on State and
local government finances. The size of these unfunded pension liabilities
relative to State and local receipts ballooned immediately after the recession and remains elevated at a level that was about 65 percent of a year’s
revenue in the first three quarters of 2015 (Figure 2-v).

1 49 out of 50 states have constitutions or statutes mandating a balanced budget and many
local governments have similar provisions. This does not prevent them from running
deficits. Many of those balanced budget statutes apply only to the operating budget, while
deficits may be allowed on their capital accounts. Also, spending from rainy day funds”
appears as a deficit on the government balance sheet in the national income and product
accounts.

only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely
to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the
longer run” (FOMC 2015).
Over the course of 2015, forecasts for the year-end federal funds rate
from both monetary policymakers and financial markets were revised down,
as shown in Figure 2-6, implying a later date of “lift off” and fewer rate
increases in 2015. By the time the FOMC voted to raise rates in December,
financial markets had largely anticipated the increase. Moreover, “lift off”
had already largely been incorporated in many investors’ expectations about
longer-term interest rates, stock prices, and the dollar. Accordingly, changes
in yields on 10-year Treasury notes (Figure 2-37) and 30-year mortgage rates
were small in the immediate wake of “lift off.”
The size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet at the end of 2015
was $4.4 trillion—more than five times its size in 2007, reflecting several
large-scale asset purchase programs (quantitative easing) from 2008 to 2014,
which are estimated to have lowered long-term interest rates by about a
percentage point (Engen et al. 2015 and the references therein). Moreover,
the Federal Reserve believes the larger stock of Federal Reserve asset holdings has continued to influence long-term interest rates even after the end

64  |  Chapter 2

of new purchases.2 The increase in the Federal Reserve assets has coincided
with a large increase in reserves held by banks. In an environment of superabundant reserves, the Federal Reserve has had to change the way in which
it raises the federal funds rate. In its communications over the course of
2014 and 2015, the FOMC indicated that the tools that the Federal Reserve
intended to use during policy normalization would include interest paid on
reserves and overnight reverse repurchase agreements.3
In recent years, FOMC participants have tended to lower their forecasts for the longer-run level for the federal funds rate. The revisions have
been consistent with downward trends in long-term interest rates in U.S.
and global financial markets.

Labor Market
The labor market continued to improve rapidly in 2015, with many
measures of labor-market performance now recovered to or near their prerecession levels. Over the course of the year, the economy added 2.7 million
jobs, completing the strongest two years of job growth since 1999. American
businesses have now added 13.8 million jobs over 70 straight months
through December, extending the longest streak on record. The unemployment rate had fallen by half from its peak during the recession to 5.0 percent
in December, its lowest level since April 2008. The robust pace of job growth
has translated into broad-based gains, but some slack remains in the labor
market, including a somewhat elevated level of part-time employment and a
depressed level of labor force participation. Moreover, the pace of nominal
wage growth picked up only modestly during 2015.
Private employment increased by 2.6 million jobs during the 12
months of 2015, after rising by 2.8 million jobs in 2014 (Figure 2-7). About
half of the jobs in 2015 came from professional and business services as well
as education and health services, both of which have been major drivers of
job growth in this recovery. These sectors account for a large part of growth
despite the fact that they make up only about 35 percent of private-sector
jobs in the economy. Education and health services added 692,000 jobs in
2 Federal Reserve Chair Yellen (2011) has stated that “the underlying theory, in which asset
prices are directly linked to the outstanding quantity of assets, dates back to the early 1950s …
Consequently, the term structure of interest rates can be influenced by exogenous shocks in
supply and demand at specific maturities. Purchases of longer-term securities by the central
bank can be viewed as a shift in supply that tends to push up the prices and drive down the
yields on those securities.”
3 See Ihrig et al. (2015) for a discussion of how interest rates paid on excess reserves and
overnight reverse repurchase agreements have replaced open market operations—the buying
and selling of Treasury securities—as the way in which the Federal Reserve achieves its target
policy rate.

2015—its largest one-year increase on record—and professional and business services added 621,000 jobs, consistent with its growth over the course
of this recovery.
Despite overall strength, particularly in the services sector, some
industries faced specific headwinds that held down growth in 2015. Slower
job growth in the oil-sensitive mining and logging sector and the exportsensitive manufacturing sector can more than account for the modest slowdown in job growth during 2015. Mining and logging lost 133,000 jobs in
2015, largely due to industry cutbacks in the face of the sharp fall in oil prices
and has reverted to its 2011 level of employment. Manufacturing also experienced a weak year of job growth, adding only 33,000 jobs, likely reflecting
the global economic slowdown dampening demand for U.S. exports. Given
that exports are comprised disproportionately of goods and manufactured
products, a slowdown in exports affects goods-producing jobs more than
the service sector.
The labor market’s improvement was also apparent in the continued
rapid decline of the unemployment rate. By December 2015, the unemployment rate had fallen to 5.0 percent, falling an average of 0.8 percentage point
a year from 2010 to 2015, below its pre-recession average of 5.3 percent.4
4 Throughout this section, pre-recession average refers to the average from December 2001 to
December 2007.

The unemployment rate reached this level before most forecasters expected.
As of March 2014, economists generally expected the unemployment rate to
remain above 5.0 percent at least until 2020 (Figure 2-8). The unexpectedly
low level of the unemployment rate, along with little pickup in inflation, also
led many economists to revise down the “natural” rate of unemployment.
Still it appears that the unemployment rate is almost back to normal levels
and the pace of decline is expected to moderate next year.
Although the overall unemployment rate is now below its pre-recession average and mirrors other indicators of labor market strength, some
broader indicators of labor market slack remained above their pre-recession
levels. For example, the long-term unemployment rate was 1.3 percent in
December, the lowest it has been since 2008 but above its pre-recession average of 1.0 percent (Figure 2-9). Despite this continued elevation, the number
of long-term unemployed fell faster in 2015 than the number of short-term
unemployed. In 2015, the long-term unemployment rate fell by 0.5 percentage point, accounting for over 85 percent of the decline in the overall
unemployment rate, though the long-term unemployed make up about
one-quarter of the unemployed. If the number of long-term unemployed
continues to fall at the same rate as it has over the past year, it will reach its
pre-recession average in 2016.

Similarly, the share of the labor force working part-time for economic
reasons, while falling steadily, remains above its pre-recession average and
could indicate continued underutilization of labor. Between December 2007
and December 2009, the share of the labor force usually working part-time
rose from 16.1 to 17.9 percent, driven by a large rise in the share of people
working part-time for economic reasons. As the recovery progressed, the
share of the labor force working part-time began to recede (Figure 2-10).5 In
2015, the share of the labor force working part-time for economic reasons
continued to fall, declining 0.5 percentage point. As of December, the rate
stood at 3.8 percent, 2.2 percentage points below its peak in 2010, but still
above its pre-recession average of 3.0 percent.
The persistence in the rate of part-time work for economic reasons, especially relative to other measures of slack, is largely responsible for the continued elevation of the U-6 “underemployment” rate. The
5 Care must be taken when comparing the share of workers who are part-time for economic
reasons before and after the 1994 redesign of the Current Population Survey. CEA used the
multiplicative adjustment factors reported by Polivka and Miller (1998) in order to place the
pre-1994 estimates of the part-time for economic reasons rate on a comparable basis with postredesign estimates. For the part-time series for which Polivka and Miller do not report suitable
adjustment factors, the pre- and post-redesign series were spliced by multiplying the pre-1994
estimates by the ratio of the January 1994 rate to the December 1993 rate. This procedure
generates similar results to the Polivka and Miller factors for series for which multiplicative
factors are available.

underemployment rate uses a broader concept of labor market slack than
the unemployment rate, including discouraged workers who have given up
on looking for a job, those marginally attached to the labor force, and those
employed part-time for economic reasons. Although it has recovered 90 percent from its peak during the recession, as of December 2015, it stood at 9.9
percent. During the 12 months of 2015, the U-6 rate declined 1.5 percentage
point (Figure 2-11).
The labor force participation rate (LFPR) edged down over the year,
by 0.1 percentage point, roughly in line with what one would have expected
based on shifting demographics. Throughout the recovery and following the
longer-term trend of population aging, the decline in the working-age share
of the population has pushed down the LFPR. Between the first quarter of
2009 and the fourth quarter of 2015, the LFPR fell 3.2 percentage points. CEA
estimates that more than half of this decline was due to the aging of the babyboom generation into retirement (Figure 2-12). These demographic-related
declines will become steeper in the near term, as the peak of the baby-boom
generation retires. Between the first quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter
of 2013, about a sixth of the participation-rate decline was due to cyclical
factors indicated by the high unemployment rates that caused potential
job-seekers to delay entry into the labor force or become discouraged. The
cyclical contribution to the participation decline has eased in recent years to

less than a tenth of the overall decline in participation as the economy has
recovered, and is likely to ease further as the unemployment rate continues
to decline. The remaining 40 percent of the decline in the participation rate
since 2009 is unrelated to population aging or changes in the unemployment
rate. This “residual” likely reflects structural factors like the longstanding
downward trend in participation among prime-age workers and other cyclical factors, such as the high levels of long-term unemployment in the Great
Recession, that are not fully captured in the unemployment rate. In 2015 the
additional drag from unexplained factors largely offset the boost to participation from the cyclical recovery. In light of ongoing demographic shifts and
longer-term trends, the participation rate is expected to decline modestly
in 2016, even as cyclical factors recede further. The Administration has
proposed policies to support labor force participation through more flexible
workplaces and paid leave, expanded high-quality pre-school, increased
subsidies for child care, and a wage insurance system that would encourage
reentry into work (Box 2-8).
As the recovery in the labor market progresses, the pace of job growth
consistent with a strong overall labor market is likely to fall as the unemployment rate begins to plateau, particularly in light of demographic patterns
(Box 2-3).

Output
Real GDP grew 1.8 percent over the four quarters of 2015, somewhat
below its pace in recent years. GDP grew at a similar pace as gross domestic
output (GDO)—a more accurate measure of output than GDP—during the
four quarters through 2015:Q3, which is the most recent quarter of GDO
data, (Figure 2-13). Gross domestic output, discussed more in Box 2-4, is a
newly published aggregate calculated as the “average of real GDP and real
gross domestic income.”
The overall composition of demand during 2015 shows that most of
the growth was accounted for by the household spending sectors: consumer
spending and residential investment, while contributions from the other
sectors were small and generally offsetting. Residential investment was the
fastest-growing major component of demand increasing 9.0 percent during
the four quarters of the year, and contributing 0.3 percentage point to the
four-quarter growth of GDP. Consumer spending, which comprises about
two-thirds of GDP, increased 2.6 percent and can account for all the year’s
output growth. In addition, sales of new cars and light trucks hit 17.4 million
in 2015, the highest level on record.

The Year in Review and the Years Ahead   |  71

Box 2-3: Expectations for Future Job Growth
Given the progress of the labor market recovery as well as ongoing
population aging, “steady state” job growth—the level consistent with a
stable, low unemployment rate—is lower than the robust growth seen
over the past several years. As the unemployment rate reaches a low
level, it is unlikely to continue declining at the same pace as earlier in
the recovery and could begin to plateau. Thus, the economy would not
need to add as many jobs to maintain a strong overall labor market.
In fact, CEA estimates that only 78,000 jobs a month would be needed
in 2016 to keep the unemployment rate unchanged at 5.0 percent (top
middle cell in Table 2-ii) if labor force participation declined in line
with demographics. In contrast, if job gains were 141,000 a month in
2016—still well below the pace in 2015—and participation declined with
its aging trend, the unemployment rate would be expected to fall another
0.5 percentage point by 2016:Q4. In reality, the relationship between jobs
and the unemployment rate could differ for a variety of reasons, including that the two series are drawn from different surveys that are subject
to different measurement errors.
Both male and female labor force participation have been falling on
an age-adjusted basis (For men, this has been happening since the 1950s;
for women, since 2000). In the business cycle from 2000 to 2007, the
labor force participation rate fell 0.15 percentage point a year, during a
period when the demographics of aging exerted little downward force on
the aggregate participation rate. If this were to continue, then only 51,000
jobs a month would be needed to stabilize the unemployment rate.
If instead, there were enough cyclical improvement to keep the
labor force participation rate constant in 2016, offsetting any aging and
other trends, then more job growth would be needed for each level of the
unemployment rate. Even if the unemployment rate falls to 4.5 percent
and there is a cyclical rebound in labor force participation, the economy
would only need to add 190,000 jobs a month, a slower pace than during
the past two years. Thus, a slower pace of job growth in 2016 would be
consistent with a normalizing and strong labor market.

Business fixed investment grew 3.1 percent, with strong growth in
intellectual property, but slow growth in equipment and structures, which
was held back by investment in the drilling sector amid low oil prices.
Inventory investment added almost a percentage point to growth at an
annual rate in the first quarter of 2015, but subtracted almost as much during the second half of the year. Manufacturing production continued to
expand, but at a slower pace than in 2014. Domestic motor vehicle assemblies grew 2.5 percent during the four quarters averaging 12.1 million units
in 2015, their highest level since 2003.
Growth in domestic demand was resilient in 2015, though weaker
foreign growth was a headwind. The aggregate of consumption and fixed
investment, known as private domestic final purchases (PDFP), also rose
faster than overall output at 2.7 percent in 2015 (Figure 2-13). The solid
pace of PDFP growth in 2015, which is typically a better predictor of the next
quarter’s future output growth than current output growth, suggests that
near-term U.S. growth prospects are positive. Nevertheless, CEA expects
that the components of real GDP that are not in PDFP, such as net exports,
will hold back overall real GDP growth next year. In particular, weaker
foreign growth likely will continue to weigh on net exports. Real exports
decreased 0.8 percent in 2015, compared with 2.4-percent growth in 2014
and 5.2-percent growth in 2013.

Consumer Spending
Real consumer spending increased 2.6 percent during the four quarters of 2015, somewhat below the 3.2-percent growth last year. Moderate
spending growth was accompanied by stronger growth in real disposable
income, due in part to the direct impact of lower oil prices (see Box 2-1), as
well as by upbeat consumer sentiment and earlier gains in household wealth.
Low interest rates and improving access to credit, particularly auto loans,
also supported consumer spending. Overall, the personal saving rate has
largely been fairly stable at around 5 percent of disposable personal income
since the beginning of 2013, implying that consumer spending growth has
largely tracked real income growth (Figure 2-14).
Growth was strong for real household purchases of durable goods (5.2
percent). Growth was moderate for nondurables (2.6 percent) and services
(2.2 percent). As discussed above in Box 2-1, CEA estimates that the direct
impact of the decline in oil prices via its reduction in net imported oil costs
since mid-2014 boosted consumer spending growth by 0.7 percentage point
in 2015 following about 0.1 percentage point in 2014.6
Light motor vehicle sales rose to 17.4 million units in 2015, the highest
level on record and the sixth consecutive yearly increase. Sales trended up
during the year, near 18 million units at an annual rate in the fourth quarter.
Motor vehicle assemblies also increased from the first to the second half of
the year and, at year end, inventory-to-sales ratios were near their long-term
averages. Between 2007 and 2014, the average age of the fleet of private light
motor vehicles rose from 10.0 to 11.4 years, likely reflecting an increase in
vehicle quality as well as some delay in new purchases during the recession. If so, replacement demand—in addition to ongoing recovery in labor
markets and income growth—should support new vehicle sales during 2016.
Consumer sentiment improved noticeably around the start of 2015 as
gasoline prices declined sharply, and remained more optimistic in 2015 than
at any point in the recovery.
In 2015, the University of Michigan’s Index of Consumer Sentiment
moved back in line with its levels before the recession and the Conference
Board Index, while still somewhat lower than before the recession, was also
at its highest level in the recovery (Figure 2-15). Relatedly, the recovery in
6Note that the estimated boost to spending in Box 2-1 is somewhat smaller since those are
contributions to GDP growth and PCE is only 68 percent of GDP. Some of the boost to
consumer spending growth from lower oil prices may be missing in the official data, since BEA
is unable to remove gasoline sales at non-gasoline establishments, such as Big Box retailers, in
its translation of the retail sales data. Sharp declines in gasoline prices make the real outlays
at these establishments, which are all treated as non-gasoline spending, look weaker than they
actually are. CEA estimates that this measurement error is understating real PCE growth by
about 0.1 percentage point during 2015.

Box 2-4: A Better Measure of Output: Gross Domestic Output (GDO)
Measuring the strength of the economy can be difficult as it
depends on surveys and administrative source data that are necessarily
imperfect and incomplete in their ability to capture a complex, dynamic,
and large economy. Official statistics measure the total output of the
economy in two distinct ways: first, gross domestic product (GDP),
which cumulates various measures of production by adding consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports; and second,
gross domestic income (GDI), which cumulates incomes by adding
labor compensation, business profits, and other sources of income. In
theory, these two measures of output should be identical; however, they
differ in practice because of measurement error. For example, the level
of GDP was about 1-percent less than GDI during the first three quarters
of 2015, though over longer time periods neither measure is typically
stronger or weaker.1
In July 2015, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) began
publishing the average of GDP and GDI—which CEA refers to as gross
domestic output (GDO). Real GDO growth is often close to real GDP
growth, but differences can be important. For example, GDO slowed
more in 2007 than GDP and gave an earlier signal of the impending
severe recession.

76  |  Chapter 2

BEA revises the official statistics on output several times because
the first estimates within months of a quarter’s end use incomplete and
preliminary data—an unavoidable tradeoff for getting a quick read on
economic activity. Research has shown that GDO can be especially helpful in predicting future revisions to GDP, and thus may improve CEA’s
ability to assess current economic conditions (CEA 2015a). In fact, when
GDO growth is initially estimated to be faster than GDP growth, GDP
growth tends to revise up and vice versa (Figure 2-vi).2 Through the
third quarter of 2015, GDP and GDO grew 2.2 percent and 2.0 percent,
respectively, from a year earlier.
GDO also sheds light on recent economic anomalies, such as the
weakness in first-quarter GDP growth in recent years. When initial
estimates showed a decline in real GDP in 2015:Q1, some analysts argued
first-quarter growth was being systematically understated because of
incomplete adjustment for seasonal changes (referred to as “residual
seasonality”). One sign of a measurement problem for the 2005-10 interval was that estimates of first-quarter GDI (and thus GDO) growth at
the time were less depressed than was first-quarter GDP growth (Figure
2-vii). In 2015, the initial estimate of first-quarter GDO growth was again

above GDP growth. In fact, at the annual revision in July, BEA revisited
its seasonal adjustment and incorporated revised source data, which led
to an upward revision in 2015:Q1 GDP growth.
It has long been the practice in many economic analyses, including
those at CEA, to combine product- and income-side measures of output
as a way to reduce measurement error and gain a more accurate picture
of the economy. In fact, CEA began using an average of GDP and GDI
with the 1997 Economic Report to the President. No single measure of the
economy is perfect. Measures are subject to measurement error, transitory shocks, and conceptual challenges. As a result, it is important to look
at multiple measures of economic conditions and over longer periods of
time to discern trends. Widening the focus from GDP to other measures
of output like GDO provides a more accurate and forward-looking
picture of the state of the economy.

income expectations was particularly welcome and likely supported spending growth in 2015. Expected real income growth, as measured in the
Michigan Survey, fell sharply during the recession and remained depressed
even after actual real income growth had begun to recover. This heightened
pessimism contrasted with the past several decades—when income expectations and actual income growth tended move together reasonably well
(Figure 2-16; Sahm 2013). Unusual caution about income prospects may
have weighed on consumer borrowing and spending growth. The rebound
in income expectations in 2015 was a sign that the extra pessimism may have
begun to wane.
Meanwhile, the debt of U.S. households relative to their disposable
income continued to fall (Figure 2-17). Before the financial crisis, household debt relative to income rose dramatically, largely due to net mortgage
originations, and then declined sharply after the crisis, a pattern known as
“deleveraging.” Charge offs of delinquent mortgage debt played an important role in lowering household debt, but the decline in new mortgage originations played a role as well (Vidangos 2015). By the end of 2015:Q2, the
debt-to-income ratio was at its lowest level since 2002. The level of mortgage
debt relative to income continued to decline in 2015, while consumer credit
(including credit card, auto, and student loans) relative to income increased
slightly.
Moreover, with historically low interest rates, the amount of income
required to service these debts has fallen dramatically. Estimates based on
aggregate data, could mask higher debt burdens for some families; that
is, the health of personal finances varies substantially across households.

Nonetheless, according to the 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances, the
fraction of families with payment-to-income ratios greater than 40 percent
declined below the level seen in 2001 (Bricker et al. 2014).
Earlier gains in household net worth (that is, assets less debts, also
referred to as household wealth) also supported consumer spending growth
in 2015, but to a lesser extent than in 2014 (Figure 2-18). Yet, declines in
equity wealth since the second quarter of 2015 have likely weighed some
on spending. The wealth-to-income ratio remained elevated in 2015, following its marked increase during 2013. Changes in net worth have been
spread unevenly across households, though, and these disparities may have
implications for families and macroeconomic activity. For example, wealth
has become increasingly concentrated, such that the share of wealth held by
the bottom 90 percent of households fell from 33.2 percent in 1989 to 24.7
percent in 2013 (Bricker et al. 2014).

Housing Markets
The housing market recovery picked up steam in 2015, undergoing
what was by some measures the largest improvement since 2007. Singlefamily home sales, bolstered by stronger labor market conditions and low
mortgage interest rates, increased substantially to their highest level since
2007. Real residential investment increased 9.0 percent during the four

Box 2-5: Are Official Estimates of GDP Missing More Growth?
While GDP growth rebounded after its sharp drop in the recession, it has held above 2 percent, on average, since 2013, despite marked
improvement in the labor market. The unemployment rate is one of
the most informative statistics on business-cycle changes in economic
activity, and generally seen as less prone to mis-measurement than real
GDP. Thus, when the unemployment rate sends a more positive signal
than GDP growth, it is natural to question, among other things, whether
measurement error in GDP has gotten worse.1 If true, this would change
one’s understanding of the economy and recovery.
Official GDP estimates from the Bureau of Economic Analysis use
high-quality data from various sources and follow international standards for national accounting. Even with diligent efforts and improving methods, accurately measuring the U.S. economy is a formidable
challenge given its size and complexity. The potential understatement
of growth in the official GDP estimates could come from incomplete
coverage of new goods and services, as well as prices that do not fully
reflect quality improvements. This is a long-standing and well-known
issue and has motivated a series of methodological improvements since
the first estimate of national income was published in 1934.
The substantial declines in the unemployment rate and robust job
gains in recent years would historically have tended to coincide with
a pickup in real GDP growth relative to its trend. Yet, as Figure 2-viii
shows, the official estimate of real GDP growth (the blue line) has held
slightly above 2 percent in recent years, as opposed to picking up. One
way to roughly quantify the amount of “missing” GDP growth vis-à-vis
labor market recovery, is with an empirical regularity known as “Okun’s
Law.” Official GDP growth has been about 1-percent point below the
output growth predicted from the labor market (the orange line) since
2005 and about 2 percentage points below since 2010.2 The persistent
discrepancy between recovery in the product market and labor market

1 For example, Hatzius and Dawsey (2015) calculated that measurement problems, including
an underestimate of the high-tech price declines and free online media, have led to official
statistics to miss 0.7 percentage point of annual growth this decade, up from 0.2 percentage
point of missing growth in the 1996-2001 period.
2 The labor-market prediction of output growth using “Okun’s Law” relies on several
assumptions and is intended as an illustration. On its own, this gap is not evidence of
measurement error in GDP. According to “Okun’s Law,” a 1 percentage point decline in
the unemployment typically coincides with a 2 percentage point pickup in real output
growth above its trend. . The trend here counterfactually assumes annual labor productivity
growth at its historical average, changes in the labor force participation rate only due to
demographics, and a constant unemployment rate of 4.9 percent.

might be a sign of a growing measurement problem or it may signal a
slowdown in trend productivity.
Goods and services without a direct market exchange have long
posed a challenge in GDP statistics, but the proliferation of free online
media and open-source software have led to claims that digital “dark
matter” is increasingly a source of missing GDP growth. Researchers
have used various methods to value the real output in this sector, despite
the fact that in some cases the inputs as well as the outputs do not have a
market price. The quantitative impact on real GDP growth in each case
is fairly modest. In many cases, the impact on consumer surplus, which
is related to how much more consumers or firms would be willing to pay
for these free goods and services, is large, but that is a measure of overall
welfare, not simply output. Taken together, however, missing GDP from
digital dark matter could be substantial; the question is whether we are
missing more GDP growth than in the past. As one example, online videos may have largely substituted for television shows, neither of which
are fully reflected in real GDP growth.
Alternate methods have led to widely different estimates of the
value of online media to consumers. One method relies on the marketvalue of consumers’ time, either to value the time they spend watching
online media, as in Brynjolfsson and Oh (2012), or to value the time
saved with online search tools, as in Varian (2011). The estimates from
this method tend to be considerable, though they are framed in terms

of consumer surplus, which should, in general, be much larger than
the contribution to GDP. There are many goods and services, such as
electricity or indoor plumbing, which consumers value more than their
market price suggests, but GDP focuses on market prices not subjective
willingness to pay. Taken together, research estimates roughly 0.4
percentage point of missing GDP growth a year from free online media
accounts since 2007 (Hatzius and Dawsey 2015).
One way to value the output from online media is by its cost of production plus the cost of advertising that supports the content. The media
is not “free” because consumers exchange exposure to ads for access
to the media. Currently, advertising is not included in GDP, because
it is treated as an intermediate good, yet this new method follows the
national accounting framework for nonmarket goods. This method
estimates much less missing GDP growth, only a few basis points of
growth a year (Nakamura and Soloveichik 2014). The main reason for
the modest overall effect is that advertising-supported media existed in
the past, and so this method weighs the substitution from advertisingpaid print media to online media. The Internet’s contribution to total
advertising growth has increased considerably, while the contribution of
print advertising has declined (Figure 2-ix).
Relative to the recession, there has been a pickup in advertising
growth, consistent with more missing GDP growth. Yet, this approach
also highlights a drawback with the official statistics, because currently

any shift from consumer-paid media to ad-supported media would show
up as a decline in output.
Open-source software is an example of an even more daunting
measurement challenge because, in many cases, it is both acquired and
produced for free.3 One way to estimate the real investment of firms in
open-source software is to use the “near-market good” approach from
Nordhaus (2006). It is less clear how much more GDP growth is missing
in recent years due to open-source software, but the expansion of online
platforms providing these goods suggests a growing measurement issue.
Taken together, it appears that the official statistics have always
missed some GDP growth, and it is possible that the bias has worsened
some in recent years, though not by nearly enough to explain the
slowdown in productivity growth or the mismatch between labor and
product market growth. Some of the measurement problems, particularly those related to quality-adjusted prices of high-tech goods, appear
to have worsened lately. Still, the contributions to GDP and productivity
growth from this mis-measurement are relatively modest, while mismeasurement in larger, hard-to-measure sectors like health care merit
further in-depth study.
3 BEA measures “own account” software based on an estimate of wages paid to computer
programmers and system analysts (see NIPA Handbook p. 6-29). To the extent that
employers are paying programmers to produce open-source software, it will be included
in BEA’s investment and GDP numbers. However, unlike traditional “prepackaged”
software, open-source software does not generate investment from the sale of copies, so less
investment is captured in GDP with the open-source approach than with traditional sales of
prepackaged software.

quarters of 2015, above the 5.1-percent growth in 2014 and far faster than
overall real GDP growth of 1.8 percent in 2015. While the cyclical recovery in the housing market is well underway, several structural challenges
remain, including a constrained housing supply, low affordability in some
areas of the country (see Box 2-6), and persistently muted household formation for 25-34 year-olds. These challenges may explain why some aspects of
the housing market or areas of the country have yet to recover.
House prices continued to rise in 2015, similar to the pace in 2014 but
below that of 2013. National home prices increased between 4 and 7 percent
(depending on the index) during 2015, broadly in line with growth in 2014
but well below the rapid growth in 2013. Nominal house prices are between
19 and 36 percent above their recessionary trough and between 5 and 7
percent below their pre-recession peak (Figure 2-19). However, in real terms

(measured relative to the general rise in consumer prices), house prices still
remain roughly 20 percent below their pre-recession peak.
Continued house price increases improved owners’ equity relative to
the debt they owe on their houses. Homeowners’ equity as of December 2015
equaled slightly more than half of the total value of household real estate (57
percent), 20 percentage points higher than the recessionary trough and near
the average of 60 percent in the two decades prior to the Great Recession.
As of 2015:Q3, rising home prices since 2012:Q4 helped lift more than 7
million households out of a negative equity position (Gudell 2015). The
overall share of single-family homeowners with an underwater mortgage
(when mortgage debt exceeds the value of their house) was 13.4 percent in
2015:Q3, down from a high of 31.4 percent in 2012. In addition, the number
of delinquent home mortgages (when the homeowner misses at least one
monthly payment) has fallen to its lowest level since 2006, though the share
of mortgages that are seriously delinquent (payment more than 90 days
overdue with the bank considering the mortgages to be in danger of default)
remains somewhat elevated. This improvement supports overall economic
growth because homeowners with underwater or delinquent mortgages are
less likely to spend or relocate in search of better-paying jobs.
Single-family homes remained more affordable in 2015 than the historical average, as rising incomes and low and steady mortgage rates partially

offset the effect of rising house prices on the cost of homeownership (Figure
2-20). Nevertheless, affordability decreased somewhat in the past two years
because median home prices grew faster than median family incomes. Box
2-6 covers an additional threat to affordability—housing supply constraints.
Despite the affordability of housing, national homeownership was 63.7
percent in the fourth quarter of 2015, much lower than the historical average
due to a variety of trends in the housing market. The decline has been particularly concentrated among young households. The homeownership rate
of those under the age of 35 was nearly 35 percent at the end of 2015, roughly
10-percentage points lower than its all-time high in 2004. A number of factors contributed to this decline. Most importantly, young adults are waiting
longer to get married or form households. First-time home buyers are about
three years older, on average, than the previous generation of homebuyers.
Second, credit availability remains tight for borrowers with credit scores
below 620. Third, it can be difficult for households, especially those living in
urban areas, to save for a down payment. In response, the Administration
has pursued policies to improve access to credit and expand homeownership. In January 2015, the President announced a reduction in the annual
mortgage insurance premium on Federal Housing Administration (FHA)
loans. The lower premium saved the typical new homeowner $900 in 2015,
and existing homeowners who refinanced realized similar savings. In addition, FHA’s new guidance for lenders of single-family loans took effect in

Box 2-6: Constraints on Housing Supply
Supply constraints provide a structural challenge in the housing
market, particularly in high-mobility, economically vibrant cities. When
housing supply is constrained, it has less room to expand when demand
increases, leading to higher prices and lower affordability. Limits on
new construction can, in turn, impede growth in local labor markets
and restrain aggregate output growth. Some constraints on the supply of
housing come from geography, while others are man-made. Constraints
due to land-use regulations, such as minimum lot size requirements,
height restrictions, and ordinances prohibiting multifamily housing,
fall into the man-made category and thus could be amended to support
more inclusive growth. While these regulations can sometimes serve
legitimate purposes such as the protection of human health and safety
and the prevention of environmental degradation, land-use regulations
can also be used to protect vested interests in housing markets.
Gyourko and Molloy (2015) argue that supply constraints have
worsened in recent decades, in large part due to more restrictive land-use
regulations. House prices have risen faster than construction costs in real
terms (Figure 2-x), providing indirect evidence that land-use regulations
are pushing up the price of land.
According to Gyourko and Molloy (2015), between 2010 and 2013,
real house prices were 55 percent above real construction costs, compared with an average gap of 39 percent during the 1990s. Several other

studies note that land-use regulations have been increasing since roughly
1970, driving much of the real house appreciation that has occurred over
this time (Glaeser, Gyourko, and Saks 2005; Glaeser and Ward 2009;
Been et al. 2014). This pattern is noteworthy because of the positive
correlation between cities’ housing affordability and the strictness of
their land use regulations, as measured by the Wharton Residential Land
Use Regulation Index (Figure 2-xi; Gyourko et al. 2008). Cities to the
lower right of the figure which include Boston and San Francisco, have
stringent land-use regulations and low affordability. Cities at the upper
left, which include St. Louis and Cleveland, have low regulation and high
affordability. Supply constraints by themselves do not make cities low
in affordability. Rather, the less responsive housing supply that results
from regulation prevents these cities, which often happen to be desirable
migration destinations for workers looking for higher-paying jobs, from
accommodating a rise in housing demand.
In addition to housing affordability, these regulations have a range
of impacts on the economy, more broadly. Reduced housing affordability—whether as an ancillary result of regulation or by design—prevents
individuals from moving to high productivity areas. Indeed, empirical
evidence from Molloy, Smith, and Wozniak (2012) indicates that migration across all distances in the United States has been in decline since the
middle of the 1980s. This decreased labor market mobility has important
implications for intergenerational economic mobility (Chetty et al. 2014)

and also was estimated in recent research to have held back current GDP
by almost 10 percent (Hsieh and Moretti 2015).
Land-use regulations may also make it more difficult for the
housing market to accommodate shifts in preferences due to changing
demographics, such as increased demand for modifications of existing
structures due to aging and increased demand for multifamily housing
due to higher levels of urbanization (Goodman et al. 2015). A number of
Administration initiatives, ranging from the Multifamily Risk-Sharing
Mortgage program to the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule, try
to facilitate the ability of housing supply to respond to housing demand.
Ensuring that zoning and other constraints do not prevent housing
supply from growing in high productivity areas will be an important
objective of Federal as well as State and local policymakers.

September 2015, while additional work is underway to further increase clarity and transparency to encourage more lending to creditworthy borrowers.
Another phenomenon holding back homeownership that has less to
do with access to credit is that, in some areas, home prices and rents are rising more quickly than either per capita personal income or wages. And real
median income for household heads aged 25-34 in 2014 remained modestly
below pre-recession levels. While homes are more affordable at the national
level, housing has become more expensive in many desirable cities like San
Jose, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, and New York (see Box 2-6).
Finally, inventories of existing homes available for sale have not recovered
fully and, by the end of 2015, were 7 percent below their average over
1997-2007.
Household formation showed some tentative signs of picking up in
recent years from the low pace prevailing since the recession. The number
of households continued to increase in 2015, albeit at a slower pace than in
2014. Most of the new households formed were among those between the
ages of 65 and 74 (Kolko 2015). This uptick contributed to a solid rise in
housing starts. Housing starts, including multifamily starts, were about 1.1
million units in 2015 (Figure 2-21). Nevertheless, starts remained well below
the 1.5-to-1.7 million rate that is consistent with long-term demographics and the replacement of existing housing stock.7 Furthermore, because
homebuilding has been below that pace since the recession, pent-up demand
for housing may play a role in supporting further recovery in the housing
7 Demographics and historical trends would have predicted 1.2 to 1.4 million new households
formed each year requiring housing (Joint Center for Housing Studies 2015). Together with the
assumption that about 0.25 percent of the existing homes deteriorate and need to be replaced a
given year, this yields an underlying trend of 1.5 and 1.7 million housing starts per year.

apartments, also picked up and now exceeds its pre-recession levels.

Investment
Business Fixed Investment. After being a bright spot early in the
recovery, investment growth moderated in 2015. Real business fixed investment grew only 1.6 percent during the four quarters of 2015, slower than
the 5-percent increase during 2012-14, and much slower that the 9-percent
increase in 2010-11. In 2015, the rate of investment growth was largely
maintained for intellectual property, but was offset by sharp declines in drilling and mining structures (see Box 2-1 for more details) and slower growth
in equipment investment. The slowdown in investment growth is largely
associated with the moderate pace of recovery in overall U.S. output and is
not limited to the United States (Box 2-7).
Slower investment growth is a concern because it limits the productive capacity of the economy. Investment net of depreciation is required to
increase the capital stock. In 2009, net investment as a share of the capital
stock fell to its lowest level in the post-World War II era, and the nominal
capital stock even declined. Although net investment has rebounded somewhat in the recovery, its level as a share of the capital stock remains well
below the historical average (Figure 2-23).
The slowdown in investment has also contributed to the slowdown
in productivity growth. Historically, capital deepening—capital per hour
worked—has added nearly 1 percentage point to labor productivity growth,
but since 2007, capital deepening has added only about a half percentage
point. The recovery in output has not been matched by a level of investment sufficient to generate substantial growth in the capital-to-labor ratio.
Changes in capital deepening tend to reverse themselves, yet the persistence
of low productivity is likely tied to the persistence of the investment slowdown. The pessimistic view is that the recent investment slowdown reflects a
trend toward less capital due to a shift toward production with lower capital
intensity, slower trend labor force growth, or fewer start-ups. The optimistic view, which is in line with historical experience, is that having largely
bounced back from the capital overhang following the Great Recession,
investment will return toward its prior, stronger trend.
With the sharp fall in output in 2008-09, the amount of capital services relative to output rose considerably (see Figure 2-24). Even years into
the recovery, businesses had access to more capital services than the level
of output would typically have required. The excess of capital suppressed
new investment and helped lower capital services growth. Capital services
relative to output have now regressed back to trend, a factor supporting

Box 2-7: Slowdown in Investment Growth
across Advanced Economies
Across advanced economies, including the United States, business
fixed investment is currently 20 percent below what would have been
expected from pre-crisis trends (Figure 2-xii). The shortfalls have been in
all categories of investment—not just business investment but also public
investment and housing.
Weak investment in advanced economies may largely be explained
by the steady, rather than increasing, pace of the recovery in output
as opposed to other issues: such as confidence, regulatory factors or
excessive share buybacks (IMF 2015). In the standard “accelerator”
model, investment increases when output growth is expected to increase.
With steady growth and some excess capacity left from the recession,
it is not that surprising that firms’ demand for investment goods has
increased slowly. Other trends common across advanced economies
may be suppressing investment, such as: a digital start-up requiring less
capital investment (Summers 2015); or constraints on entry of new firms
(Decker et al. 2014).

of investment growth being, on average, followed by stronger periods. This
historical pattern argues for faster growth in investment spending during
2016 than in the recent past.

On the other hand, there are longer-running trends of less dynamism
in the business sector, as discussed in Chapter 5 on innovation, pre-dating
the last recession that could suggest persistently lower investment. The share
of new firms among all firms—the start-up rate—has trended down over the
past decades and fell further in this recovery. Moreover, research has shown
that start-ups and young firms, which engage heavily in hiring and investment, are also failing at a higher rate since 2000 (Decker et al. forthcoming).
The Administration has pursued policies to support investment, including
additional funding for public research and development and public infrastructure. In addition, the President has proposed business tax reform that
would directly spur private investment. (See also Box 2-8).
While investment has been low, the rate of payouts to shareholders by
nonfinancial firms, in the form of dividends or net share buybacks (Figure
2-25) has been rising. Nonfinancial corporations are now returning nearly
half of the funds that could be used for investment to stockholders. The
share of funds being returned to stockholders, both in the form of dividends
and net share buy backs, has been gradually trending higher for several
decades and the current combined level was markedly exceeded only in the
run-up to the last recession. The lower investment growth and higher share
of funds returned to shareholders suggests firms had more cash than they
thought they could profitably invest. The rise in payouts to shareholders
may be related to the decline in the start-up rate as young firms are more
likely to re-invest their cash flow than mature firms.
Inventory Investment. Inventories increased faster than final sales
in 2015, pushing up manufacturing and trade inventories to 1.48 months’
supply in November 2015. The inventory-to-sales ratio has risen this year,
but has trended down over the past few decades, likely reflecting changes
in supply-chain management and the diminishing share of goods in GDP
(Figure 2-26). The unusually high level of oil inventories in 2015, related to
both upside surprises in the supply of oil and weaker-than-expected global
demand for oil, is a portion of the inventory buildup.
Real inventory investment—the change in the inventory stock—
picked up noticeably in the first quarter of 2015, adding 0.9 percentage
point to first-quarter GDP growth, and remained high in the second quarter.
Inventory investment averaged about $113 billion at an annual rate in the
first two quarters of the year, well above the $50 billion level of inventory
investment needed to keep up with average sales growth. The third quarter
saw a drop back down to $86 billion, subtracting 0.7 percentage point from
GDP growth. Inventory investment declined further in the fourth quarter to
$69 billion and subtracted 0.5 percentage point from GDP growth. As shown

in Figure 2-27, changes in inventory investment often affect the quarterly
pattern of output growth, but have limited effect on annual growth.

Net Exports
Weak demand in much of the world outside the United States—as
discussed more in Chapter 3—and the stronger dollar that has come with
it has been a drag on U.S. exports, which declined 6.9 percent in nominal
terms during 2015. Part of this was due to the drop in export prices, as
lower oil and commodity prices have meant lower prices for U.S. exports of
agricultural goods or oil-related products. Adjusting for prices, real exports
declined 0.8 percent during the four quarters of 2015, shown in Figure 2-28.
At the same time, real U.S. imports increased 3.4 percent, reflecting both the relative strength of domestic demand and the lower price of
imports. Taken together, Figure 2-29 shows net exports subtracted 0.6 percentage point from GDP growth during 2015, after subtracting a comparable
amount to overall growth in 2014. The external sector is likely to be a drag
on growth in 2016 as well.

Productivity
Although employment growth has been strong, the growth in output
has been more moderate. Thus, recent growth of labor productivity (that

is, output per hour) has been below its long-term average pace. Because
productivity fluctuates with the business cycle, it should be measured over a
long interval, or between comparable cyclical stages. When measured with
product-side data from the national income and product accounts (the measure published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and based on data from the
Bureau of Economic Analysis), labor productivity has risen at a 1.2-percent
annual rate during the almost eight years from the business cycle peak in
2007:Q4 to 2015:Q3. But when using the income-side measure, nonfarm
productivity has risen at a 1.6-percent rate. The best measure of productivity
growth is probably the average of these figures, similar to the average used
for gross domestic output in Box 2-4, yielding an estimate of a 1.4-percent
annual rate of growth in productivity thus far in this business cycle. This is
a slower pace of growth than the 2.2-percent growth seen between businesscycle peaks in 1953 and 2007, partially due to the transitory after-effects
of the severe recession, including reduced investment associated with the
capital overhang.
The slowdown in labor productivity growth in the post-recessionary
period can be attributed to lower growth in total factor productivity and a
reduction in capital intensity, as shown in Figure 2-30. Historically, capital
intensity, or changes in capital per hour, has added nearly 1 percentage point
to labor productivity growth. But, since 2007, capital intensity has added
about a half percentage point, as discussed previously in the investment section. Thus, reduced capital deepening can account for roughly a third of the
below-average productivity growth since 2007. Moreover, the contribution
from total factor productivity growth over the past few years has been half its
historical average of 1.1 percentage points. Increasing public infrastructure
investment, an issue discussed in Chapter 6, and raising educational levels,
as discussed in Chapter 4, will support labor productivity growth.
Since 2010:Q4, productivity growth has been even lower, averaging
only 0.7 percent per year (using information from the income and product
sides of the accounts). It is difficult to interpret productivity growth over
very short windows, in part because it is affected by changing business-cycle
conditions and also because it is subject to sizeable measurement error.
Nevertheless, the same pattern applies even more strongly to this shorter
window, with the majority of the most recent slowdown in productivity
growth accounted for by the reduction in the amount of capital services
per worker. As shown in Figure 2-31, a decline in capital intensity has not
occurred previously in the postwar period.
How should recent productivity growth color forecasts of future productivity? The degree that a slowdown in capital accumulation has played
an important role in the recent slower productivity growth offers some

grounds for optimism about the future. Historically, capital accumulation
tends to pick up after a period of weakness. This could be even truer in the
wake of the Great Recession, which is a rare enough event in its severity
that it should not form a basis for future extrapolations about long-run
trends. Moreover, historically longer time periods have given more accurate
readings on future productivity growth. Labor productivity growth since
the business-cycle peak in 1953 has averaged 2.1 percent a year, the figure
that the Administration uses to project the long-term growth rate of labor
productivity. Administration policies supporting infrastructure investment,
education, trade, and immigration reform, will help facilitate the acceleration from the slow growth rate of recent years. However, in the near-term,
the Administration’s outlook foresees a continuation of relatively subdued
productivity growth in 2016 but then a pickup in subsequent years.

Wage Growth and Price Inflation
Nominal wage growth began to slowly pick up in 2015, but, with the
strengthening labor market, has room to rise even further. Average nominal
hourly earnings for all private employees increased 2.7 percent during the
12 months of 2015, compared with 1.8 percent on average in the two prior
years. Hourly compensation, as measured in the Employment Cost Index,
increased 1.9 percent in 2015, down from 2.3 percent a year earlier. In
contrast, the more-volatile compensation per hour rose 3.1 percent during
2015, above its 2.8 percent growth a year earlier. Taken together, as shown
in Figure 2-32, wage growth has moved up gradually as labor markets have
tightened, but has not reached a pace that would signal a full recovery. An
important question in the labor market this year will be whether nominal
wages will continue to grow faster as the labor market tightens.
Consumer prices, as measured in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and shown in Figure 2-33, were up only
slightly over 2015 due to large declines in energy prices (see Figure 2-34).
Overall inflation was well below the Federal Reserve’s longer-run objective
of 2 percent. Core PCE inflation—which excludes energy and food prices
and tends to be a better predictor of future inflation than overall inflation—
was also less than the 2-percent target, rising only 1.4 percent during the
12 months of 2015.8 Lower imported goods as well as the pass through of
8 The Federal Reserve’s defines its inflation objective in terms of the PCE price index. The
consumer price index (CPI) is an alternate measure of prices paid by consumers and is used
to index some government transfers and taxes. Largely because of a different method of
aggregating the individual components, PCE inflation has averaged about 0.3 percentage point
a year less than the CPI inflation since 1979. During the 12 months of 2015, for example, core
CPI prices increased 2.1 percent, more than the 1.4 percent increase in core PCE prices.

lower energy costs to non-energy goods likely weighed on core inflation this
year. The speed and degree to which these factors wane are two keys to the
inflationary pressures in the economy this year.
Changes in import prices can meaningfully affect domestic price
inflation through various channels. If imports become less expensive, then
domestic price inflation may be reduced as consumers switch to relatively
cheaper goods from abroad. Competitive pressures from lower import
prices may also lead domestic producers to lower their prices. Finally, the
lower price inflation for imported inputs may be passed through to goods
produced domestically. Prices for non-oil imports declined sharply in 2015,
weighing on domestic core price inflation (Figure 2-33). Over the four quarters of 2015, the price of non-oil imports fell 3.6 percent, the largest fourquarter decline since 2009:Q3. The decline in non-oil import prices likely
reflects a stronger dollar as well as falling non-energy commodity prices.
The pass through of non-oil import prices to core inflation is expected to
continue, albeit to a lesser extent, in 2016.
Survey-based measures of long-term expectations for inflation, have
been generally well-anchored, both during the last recession and more
recently. This steadiness suggests a view that the factors that pushed down
inflation in 2015 will be temporary as well as confidence that the Federal
Reserve will be able to address any inflationary pressures in the coming
years. Nevertheless, market-based measures of inflation compensation

(estimated from the rates on Treasury inflation protected securities) have
declined, raising some concerns about long-term inflation expectations.

Financial Markets
Over the course of the year, developments in U.S. financial markets
largely reflected diminished prospects for global growth, particularly in
China and other emerging markets, and expected tightening of monetary
policy. At the same time, consensus forecasts of long-run U.S. interest rates
have fallen, following the long downward trend that reflects a variety of factors ranging from demographics to changing term premiums. This section,
like the rest of this chapter, focuses on developments through the end of
2015. In early 2016, U.S. and global equity indexes and commodity prices—
especially oil—fell while spreads on high-yield bonds rose.
Since the early 1980s, long-term interest rates, as measured by the
yields on 10-year Treasury notes, have trended downward, as shown in
Figure 2-36. The evolution of U.S. interest rates over the past 20 years has
coincided with interest-rate movements in advanced economies, including
the United Kingdom and the euro area. The global trend in long-term rates
is partly the result of lower inflation, lower foreign output growth, aging
demographics, lower investment demand, and increased world saving, as
evidenced by the reduction in rates beginning well before the financial

crisis.9 But these changes have been greatly exacerbated by some more
transitory factors, including the effects of quantitative easing on the supply
of long-term debt, lower term premiums, private-sector deleveraging, and
flight-to-safety flows.
Longer-term interest rates, as measured by the yields on 10-year U.S.
Treasury notes and shown in Figure 2-37, were relatively stable, on net, in
2015, ending the year at 2.3 percent, about the same rate as at the end of
2014, but noticeably down from year-end 2013. The yields on 3-month U.S.
Treasury notes also remained low in 2015, only starting to rise meaningfully
above zero in mid-November, reflecting expectations for the FOMC to raise
its target rate.
Similarly, corporate borrowing costs rebounded almost 70 basis
points over the 12 months of 2015 to 4.9 percent, roughly in line with
its level at year-end 2013. Increased corporate bond yields coupled with
roughly unchanged Treasury yields point to rising credit spreads.
Market estimates for long-term U.S. Treasury rates increased over the
past year. The 10-year U.S. Treasury rate, 10 years forward, which measures
the market’s expectation of the 10-year interest rate a decade from today,
was 3.2 percent in December 2015. The market-based forward rate was
nearly 1 percentage point below the consensus forecast of 4.1-percent for
2022-26. Some of the gap may be explained by a lower term premium, global
flight-to-safety flows, or divergent expectations about long-term productivity and output growth. Forward rates incorporate risk premiums, can be
highly volatile, and their movements may reflect transitory developments
as opposed to structural changes; as such, they may be poor predictors for
future rates. For a more in-depth analysis into the 10-year U.S. Treasury
rate, 10 years forward, and the overall shift to lower long-term rates, see the
Council of Economic Advisers (2015) report, “Long-Term Interest Rates: A
Survey.”
Overall stock prices were little changed, on net, in 2015. The Standard
and Poor’s 500 (S&P) index edged down less than 1 percent for the year,
following a 30 percent rise in 2013 (the best year since 1997) and another 11
percent rise in 2014. In the first half of 2015, the S&P index had increased;
however, declines since August erased most of the year’s gains. Nevertheless,
at the end of December 2015, the S&P index was about 30 percent above its
pre-recession peak in 2007.

9 Recent aging of the baby-boom generation has led to a disproportionate share of the
population being distributed into age cohorts with relatively high saving rates, which in turn,
has held down interest rates. Continued aging of the baby-boom generation will likely exert
upward pressure on interest rates as its members enter retirement and consume their savings.

The Outlook
Forecast over the Next Three Years
Real GDP grew 2.2 percent on average during the three years
through 2015, and the Administration forecast (finalized on November
17, 2015) projects an acceleration to 2.7-percent growth during 2016. The
Administration forecast is slightly above the Blue-Chip consensus forecast
of 2.6 percent and in line with the CBO forecast of 2.7 percent, two outside
forecasts from January 2016. The Administration expects that investment
will grow faster in 2016 than in the recent past, though weaker global
demand likely will be partially offsetting. Federal fiscal policy will be simulative in 2016 and even more so than it might otherwise have been without the
Bipartisan Budget Agreement. With a strengthening State and local sector,
fiscal actions will likely be expansionary in 2016. Meanwhile, core inflation
(excluding food and energy) remains low, partly due to declining import
prices, and below average capacity utilization, so resource utilization does
not appear to impose any constraints during the next four quarters. For
consumers, a pickup in nominal and real wage gains in 2015—together with
strong employment growth—will probably boost spending in 2016. These
income gains—following a multiyear period of successful deleveraging—
leave consumers in an improved financial position. Business investment
also shows brighter prospects for growth in 2016 than in earlier years as the
overhang of excess capital that suppressed investment earlier in this expansion has been reduced. As the economy continues to grow, businesses will
need new facilities, equipment, and intellectual property to meet growing
demand. The decline in oil prices over the last year and half are likely to add
to GDP, on net, in 2016, as discussed in Box 2-1.
Although most domestic signals are positive, the United States faces
headwinds from abroad. The available indicators suggest that the economies of Brazil, Canada, China, India, and our euro area trading partners
are growing slowly. The trade-weighted average of foreign GDP growth in
2015 was slower than in 2014. Slow global growth is forecasted for 2016 as
well. Weakness abroad not only reduces our exports, but also raises risks of
adverse financial and other spillovers to the U.S. economy.
With broader measures of labor market slack somewhat elevated
and the capacity utilization rate in manufacturing at about 76 percent, the
economy still has a bit of room to grow faster than its potential rate. Even if
the unemployment rate falls below the level consistent with long-run stable
inflation, near-term inflation likely will be held down by the recent declines

in import prices. And even if inflation increases modestly, it may remain
below the Federal Reserve’s long-run target of 2-percent inflation.
The Administration’s economic forecast, presented in Table 2-2,
underpins the President’s FY 2017 budget. When the Administration
forecast was finalized in November 2015, real GDP growth during the four
quarters of 2015 was projected at 2.2 percent. Data released after the forecast was finalized point to real GDP growth during 2015 that is below the
Administration’s forecast.
By long-standing convention, this forecast reflects the economic
effects of the President’s budgetary and other economic policy proposals in
the FY 2017 budget. Together these act to increase the growth rate of GDP
during the 10-year budget window (Box 2-8).
Real GDP is projected to grow 2.7, 2.5, and 2.4 percent during the four
quarters of 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. These growth rates exceed
the Administration’s estimated rate of potential real GDP growth over the
long run of 2.3 percent a year. As a consequence, the unemployment rate is
likely to fall from its 5.0 percent level in 2015:Q4—eventually falling to 4.5
percent in 2016:Q4 and remaining at that level before ticking back up to 4.6
percent in 2017:Q4. These levels, below the Administration’s estimate of
4.9 percent for the rate of unemployment consistent with stable inflation,
can be expected to incrementally raise inflation. As discussed in (Box 2-9),
the effect of unemployment on changing the rate of inflation appears to
have diminished in recent decades and estimates derived over the past two
decades suggest that if the unemployment rate were to remain 1 percentage point below the stable-inflation rate of unemployment for a full year,

then the rate of inflation would increase by 0.2 percentage point. In the
Administration forecast, the economy will be below the stable-inflation level
of unemployment by an average of 0.3 percentage point in 2016, 2017, and
2018, which can be expected to raise the rate of core inflation by less than 0.1
percentage point each year. With the rate of core PCE inflation during 2015
at 1.4 percent, the 0.2-percentage point inflation increase during the next
three years would still leave the rate of inflation at the end of 2018 below the
Federal Reserve’s 2-percent target for this index.
Nominal interest rates are currently low because of a reduction in the
long-run interest rate and that the economy has not fully healed from the
last recession. Monetary policy has also kept rates low. Consistent with the
Federal Reserve’s forward policy guidance at the time of the Administration
forecast, long-term interest rates are projected to rise, consistent with the
rise in short-term rates. Eventually, real interest rates (that is, nominal
rates less the projected rate of inflation) are predicted to move toward, but
still remain well below, their historical average. These interest-rate paths
108  |  Chapter 2

are close to those projected by the consensus of professional economic
forecasters. During the past several years, consensus forecasts for long-term
interest rates and long-term economic growth have fallen, reflecting changes
in views on productivity, the term premium, along with other global and
domestic factors.

Forecast over the Long Term
As discussed earlier, the long-run growth rate of the economy is
determined by the growth of its supply-side components, including those
governed by demographics and technological change. The growth rate
that characterizes the long-run trend in real U.S. output—or potential
output—plays an important role in guiding the Administration’s long-run
forecast. The potential output projections are based on the assumption that
the President’s full set of policy proposals, which would boost long-run
output, are enacted (Box 2-8) After three years of growth above potential
through 2017, real output growth shifts down to its long-term trend rate of
2.3 percent. These growth rates are slower than historical averages due to the
retirement of the baby-boom generation and slower growth of the workingage population.
Table 2-3 shows the Administration’s forecast for the contribution of
each supply-side factor to the growth in potential real output: the workingage population; the rate of labor force participation; the employed share
of the labor force; the length of the workweek; labor productivity; and the
difference between productivity growth for the economy as a whole and the
nonfarm business sector. The two columns of Table 2-3 show the average
annual growth rate for each factor during a long period of history and over
the forecast horizon. The first column shows the long-run average growth
rates between the business-cycle peak of 1953 and the latest quarter available
when the forecast was finalized (2015:Q3). Many of these variables show
substantial fluctuations within business cycles, so that long-period growth
rates must be examined to uncover underlying trends. The second column
shows average projected growth rates between 2015:Q3 and 2026:Q4; that is,
the entire 11¼-year interval covered by the Administration forecast.
The population is projected to grow 1.0  percent a year, on average,
over the projection period (line 1, column 2), following the latest projection
from the Social Security Administration. Over this same period, the labor
force participation rate is projected to decline 0.4 percent a year (line 2, column 2). This projected decline in the labor force participation rate primarily
reflects a negative demographic trend from the retirement of the baby-boom
generation. During the next couple of years, however, rising labor demand

Box 2-8: Policy Proposals to Raise Output over the Next-Ten Years
The Administration has a wide-ranging and robust economic
agenda that, if enacted, would expand the labor force and boost productivity. In line with long-standing precedent, the Administration’s
economic forecast incorporates the impact of the President’s policy
proposals. CEA estimates that, in total, these proposals would add over
5 percent to the level of output in 2026. The Administration’s economic
forecast, however, only incorporates 3-percentage points of the total
boost to the level of output from these proposals. This adds about 0.3
percentage point on average to annual growth over the next 10 years.
The remaining 2 percentage points are not included in the forecast for
reasons discussed below. As a result, the Administration’s forecast for
the level of output in 2026 is about 1 percent higher than the forecasts
from both the Congressional Budget Office and the Blue Chip consensus
panel, as well as about 4 percent higher than the median forecast from
the Federal Open Market Committee.
Immigration reform. The policy proposal with the largest effect
on output is immigration reform, as embodied in the bipartisan Border
Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act
that passed the U.S. Senate in June 2013. CBO (2013b) estimated that this
legislation, if enacted, would raise the level of real GDP by 3.3 percent
after 10 years. This effect is so large because immigration reform would
benefit the economy by counteracting the effects of an aging native-born
population, attracting highly skilled immigrants that engage in innovative or entrepreneurial activities, and enabling better job-matching for
currently undocumented workers who are offered a path to citizenship.
Much of the overall effect is due to an expanded workforce, a factor that
is incorporated in the budget savings from immigration reform. Thus,
to avoid double counting in the budget savings, the workforce effects
of immigration reform are not incorporated in the economic forecast.
However, 0.7 percentage point of the total effect from immigration
reform is due to increased total factor productivity, and this is reflected
in the Administration’s economic forecast.
Policies to expand cross-border trade and investment. The other
set of policies with a large effect on output are a number of international agreements that would boost cross-border trade and investment,
including the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the Transatlantic Trade
and Investment Partnership (TTIP), an expansion of the Information
Technology Agreement (ITA), a Trade in Services Agreement (TISA),
and a possible Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) with China. TPP negotiations have concluded, and the Administration is working with Congress
to secure its passage. A new study supported by the Peterson Institute for

110  |  Chapter 2

International Economics (Petri and Plummer 2016) finds that TPP could
raise U.S. real income by 0.5 percent in 2030. The European Commission
(2013) estimates a roughly similar effect of TTIP on the U.S. economy,
an increase of 0.4 percent in GDP in 2027.
Investments in surface transportation infrastructure. The
Administration recognizes that investments in infrastructure support
economic growth by creating jobs, boosting productivity, and strengthening the manufacturing sector. In December 2015, the bipartisan Fixing
America’s Surface Transportation Act (H.R. 22), which authorizes a $17.8
billion increase in surface transportation investment over five years, was
enacted into law. This funding is an important down payment, but the
country must further transform our transportation system to achieve a
cleaner, safer transportation future. The President’s FY 2017 budget calls
for $32 billion per year over 10 years to support innovative programs that
make our communities more livable and sustainable. The IMF (2014)
estimates that given the current underutilization of resources in many
advanced economies, a 1 percent of GDP permanent increase in public
infrastructure investment could help increase output by as much as 2.5
percent after 10 years. See Chapter 6 in this Report for more discussion.
Policies to boost labor force participation. The Administration
has pursued policies that enable all workers to participate in the labor
force to their full potential by making it easier for workers to balance
career and family responsibilities. The Administration’s FY 2017 budget
calls to triple the maximum child care tax credit to $3,000 for children
younger than 5, while enabling more middle-class families to receive the
maximum credit. In addition, every year since 2013, the President has
proposed a Federal-State partnership that would provide all 4-year olds
from low- and moderate-income families with access to high-quality
preschool. Finally, the budget calls to provide technical assistance to
help States implement and develop paid parental leave programs. These
policies would increase labor force participation and the level of output.
Policies to make college affordable. The Administration is committed to making college affordable. The budget includes $60.8 billion
over 10 years to make the first two years of community college tuition
free for responsible students through a Federal-State cost sharing
partnership. This plan would increase America’s human capital and
productivity by enabling 2 million people who would not have enrolled
in college to earn an associate’s degree.
Business tax reform. President Obama’s framework for business tax reform issued in 2012 sets out a series of changes that would
strengthen the economy in three main ways. First, by lowering average
tax rates, the President’s plan would boost investment in the United

The Year in Review and the Years Ahead   |  111

States. Second, by moving to a more neutral tax system, the proposals
would result in a more efficient allocation of capital. And third, to the
degree the new system better addresses externalities, for example with a
more generous research and development credit, it would also increase
total factor productivity and therefore growth. (See Chapter 5 of last
year’s Report for a discussion of the economic benefits of business tax
reform.)
Deficit reduction. CBO’s (2013a) analysis of the macroeconomic
effects of alternative budgetary paths estimates that a hypothetical $2
trillion in primary deficit reduction over 10 years raises the long-term
level of real GDP by 0.5 percent. This effect arises because lower Federal
deficits translate into higher national saving, lower interest rates, and in
turn, greater private investment. The Administration’s FY 2017 budget
proposal includes $2.5 trillion in primary deficit reduction relative to
the Administration’s plausible baseline. Using CBO’s methodology this
would raise the level of output in 2026 by 0.6 percent.

due to the continuing business-cycle recovery is expected to offset some of
this downward trend.
The employed share of the labor force—which is equal to one minus
the unemployment rate—is expected to rise less than 0.1 percent a year
during the next 11 years because the long-run unemployment rate is only
slightly below the rate in 2015:Q3. The workweek is projected to be roughly
flat during the forecast period, following a long-term decline of 0.2 percent
a year. The workweek is expected to stabilize because some of the demographic forces pushing it down are largely exhausted.
Labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector is projected to
increase 2.1 percent a year over the entire forecast (line 6, column 2), the
same as the average growth rate from 1953 to 2015 (line 6, column 1).
Productivity tends to grow faster in the nonfarm business sector than for
the economy as a whole, because productivity in the government and household sectors of the economy is presumed (by a national-income accounting
convention) not to grow (that is, output in those two sectors grows only
through the use of more production inputs). The difference in these growth
rates is expected to subtract 0.3 percent a year during the projection, similar
to the 0.2 percent a year decline historically (line 10, columns 1 and 2). This
productivity differential is equal to the sum of two other growth rates in the
table: the ratio of nonfarm business employment to household employment
(line 4) and the ratio of real output to nonfarm business output (line 7).
Summing the growth rates of all of its components, real output is
projected to rise at an average 2.4 percent a year over the projection (line

8, column 2), slightly faster than the 2.3 percent annual growth rate for
potential real output (line 9, column 2). Actual output is expected to grow
faster than potential output primarily because of the small projected rise in
the employment rate (that is, the decline in the unemployment rate) as currently unemployed workers find jobs, and others reenter the labor force or
shift from part-time to full-time jobs.
Real potential output (line 9, column 2) is projected to grow less than
the long-term historical growth rate of 3.1 percent a year (line 9, column

population and the retirement of the baby-boom cohort. If the effects of

Box 2-9: Stable Inflation Rate of Unemployment
Economic theory generally relates inflation rates and unemployment rates under the view that very low unemployment may signal tight
labor markets that generate upward pressure on wages and high demand
for goods and services that put upward pressure on prices. The accelerationist Phillips curve relates the increase in the rate of inflation to the rate
of unemployment, or possibly some other measure of economic slack.
It can also be used in conjunction with other inflation-sector equations
to derive estimates for the rate of unemployment that keeps inflation
stable (NAIRU), an essential notion for maximizing growth without ever
increasing inflation rates. According to the Phillips curve, an unemployment rate below the one that would keep inflation stable will result in
upward pressure on price inflation. Many have noted that the fit of the
Phillips curve has deteriorated (for instance, Ball and Mazumder 2011).
They observed that the Phillips curve would have predicted inflation to
fall much more during the Great Recession than it did.
The deterioration in the ability of a simple Phillips curve model to
fit the data is shown in Figure 2-x. As shown by the equation embedded
in Figure 2-x, the change in the rate of inflation from its expectation
(on the left hand side) is regressed against a demographically adjusted
unemployment rate and a constant term. (From this regression, one can
estimate the NAIRU as the ratio of the coefficient on the unemployment
rate to the constant.) The measure of inflation expectations is lagged

inflation up to 2007 and then expectations from the Federal Open
Market Committee onward. Measuring inflation by the core CPI (that
is, excluding food and energy), Figure 2-x depicts the goodness-of-fit
(known as R²) over rolling 20-year periods. During the 1990s, this relationship was robust, averaging an R2 of 0.46 (meaning that movements
in the unemployment rate accounted for 46 percent of the variation in
inflation). Over an estimation period that includes the past 20 years,
however, the R² is only slightly above zero (meaning that this model
explains almost none of the recent variation in inflation).
The deterioration in fit in this Phillips curve relationship results in
dramatically less precise estimates for the NAIRU, as shown in Figure
2-xi, which shows the band associated with a 50-percent probability that
the true estimate lies within.1 An increased goodness-of-fit corresponds
to a thinner confidence band, implying less uncertainty over the true
value of the NAIRU. Since 2011 though, uncertainty surrounding the
true NAIRU has risen: A mere 50-percent confidence band in 2014
ranges from –4.3 to 6.1, providing little certainty over the current rate of
unemployment that will keep inflation stable. Moreover this is only one
model of the NAIRU, other models show similar increases in uncertainty
over time and the total uncertainty is even larger than shown by any

individual model because of uncertainty over the true process driving
inflation.
Similarly, the coefficient on the unemployment gap has changed
noticeably, evolving toward zero as shown in Figure 2-xii. Over the
entire estimation period, this coefficient has been about –0.4 (meaning
that every point-year of low unemployment raises the rate of inflation by
four-tenths of a percentage point). In contrast, from 2002 to 2010, this
coefficient averaged about –0.25, implying that for each point-year of
unemployment rate below the NAIRU, inflation would rise by a quarter
of a percentage point. And the most recent estimate suggests that each
point-year of an unemployment rate below the NAIRU would result in a
0.03-percentage point increase in the inflation rate.
Although uncertainty surrounding the NAIRU has risen drastically
over the past few years, a small coefficient on the unemployment rate
reduces the economic importance of a precise estimate for the NAIRU.
With an unemployment coefficient of -0.25 or less, an estimated NAIRU
that differs by half of a percentage point from its true value will only
move core CPI inflation slightly.

then potential real output growth would exceed the 2.3-percent rate shown

Upside and Downside Forecast Risks. Like any forecast, the
Administration’s economic forecast is uncertain, and several risks are
worth enumerating here. One upside risk is from the homebuilding sector
which has some upside potential given the current low level of household
formation and its potential for increase. Another upside risk would be
that more workers are drawn back into the labor force than expected. On
the downside, it appears that growth in China and many other emergingmarket countries is slowing, which may reduce U.S. exports. In addition,
financial market developments—either reflecting spillovers from abroad or
U.S.-specific issues—are another downside risk. Over the longer-run, there
are some downside risks to the estimate of potential growth insofar as more
recent lower productivity growth rates continue. Yet, as Box 2-5, discusses,
some of the recent slowdown in productivity growth may be an artifact of
the measurement issues in the official statistics and not entirely a reflection
of the economy.

Conclusion
	 The economy continued to strengthen during 2015, especially in
the labor market with robust employment gains and continued declines in
unemployment. Job growth continued to exceed 200,000 a month for the
year as a whole, extending the longest streak of uninterrupted private-sector
job growth on record and contributing to an American recovery that has
outpaced most other advanced economies. Demand is strong is the United
States, especially in the household sector, and will continue to support solid
growth in 2016.At the same time, we face challenges associated with the
slowing global economy that are discussed in the next Chapter.
Looking ahead, some of the most important decisions that we make
as a Nation are the structural policies that influence long-term growth. The
President’s budget sets forth a number of policies that can be expected to
increase the level or long-term growth rate of potential output.
Such policies also aim to boost aggregate demand in the near term and
to improve our long-term competitiveness, while promising fiscal restraint
over the long run. They are an essential complement to policies that make
sure this growth is shared by the middle class and those working to get into
the middle class.

THE GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC
SITUATION

A

lthough the United States experienced continued growth and robust
job creation, the global economy in 2015 had unexpectedly low growth
across many regions relative to expectations and even relative to the moresubdued growth seen in recent years. The downward shift in growth has
both a broader, longer-term aspect, as it has applied to both many advanced
economies and emerging markets continuously over the last five years, and
a more acute presentation over the last year and into the beginning of 2016
arising in large part from developments in emerging markets. The broader
downward revisions to growth forecasts have involved an overall environment of weak global demand, disappointing global productivity, and shifting
demographics. While both advanced and emerging economies have missed
growth expectations, over the last year a number of advanced economies
have roughly met or exceeded expectations, while the biggest downward
revisions in forecasts have been among large emerging market countries.
To illustrate the unexpected nature of the developments, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in January 2016 estimated global real
gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 3.1 percent in 2015 and predicted
that it would rise to 3.4 percent in 2016 (IMF 2016). The Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), in a separate analysis
in November 2015, forecast global growth of 2.9 percent in 2015 and 3.3
percent in 2016 (OECD 2015). Both of these growth estimates for 2015 were
well below those forecasted just over a year earlier of 3.8 percent and 3.7
percent, respectively. The deteriorating estimates underscore that weaker
global growth, particularly among U.S. trading partners, was a headwind to
U.S. economic growth in 2015.
The IMF’s estimated 3.1-percent growth rate of global real GDP in
2015 was slightly lower than the growth rate over the last three years, and
well below both the growth rate earlier in the recovery and the pre-crisis
average of between 4 and 5 percent. This slowdown was not anticipated in
119

earlier forecasts. Figure 3-1 shows the IMF’s forecast for global growth at
different points in time. The solid line represents the actual growth outcomes while the dotted lines show the forecast. At first, as growth slowed,
the IMF—along with most other forecasters—expected a near-term pickup
in growth to over 4 percent. Growth has fallen short of expectations in many
regions, including both advanced and emerging-market economies.
The global slowdown and the contrast in U.S. growth expectations
compared with the world have contributed to a major appreciation of the
U.S. dollar. The real trade-weighted dollar as measured by the Federal
Reserve’s broad index began appreciating sharply in mid-2014 and strengthened 17 percent between July 2014 and December 2015 (see Figure 3-2).
This is a historically large appreciation. Since the collapse of the Bretton
Woods system in the early 1980s, the dollar has appreciated that quickly
only two other times: first during the sharp monetary tightening in the early
1980s and again after the onset of the East Asian Crisis in 1997-98. Among
the drivers of the recent appreciation is the strong performance of the U.S.
economy against a backdrop of relatively weak growth in the rest of the
world. As a result, U.S. Federal Reserve policy is at a different juncture than
monetary policy in most foreign countries. While markets expect the Federal
Reserve to reduce monetary policy accommodation throughout 2016, the
European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) are in the midst
of maintaining or expanding monetary stimulus with the aim of raising
inflation from low levels toward 2 percent.
As discussed in Chapter 2, the slowdown in global growth is a headwind for the U.S. economy—contributing to slower growth of exports. Real
net exports subtracted more than half a point from U.S. real GDP growth
over the four quarters of 2015 on a growth accounting basis. In addition, if
the global situation deteriorated, it would present a more substantial risk
to the U.S. economy—as well as to economies worldwide. That is why it is
critical for economies around the world to focus on growth, undertaking
the necessary steps to expand demand, reform supply, encourage trade, and
manage economic and financial developments as appropriate in different
contexts.

Sources of the Broader Slowdown
The slower growth in the world economy relative to the pre-crisis era
stems largely from slowdowns relative to expectations in emerging-market
economies, including large economies like India and China, as well as disappointing growth in Europe. Figure 3-3 compares the growth of GDP per
working-age person from 2011 to 2014 relative to 2002 to 2007, with points

on the 45-degree line representing unchanged growth rates between these
two periods. In general, while they may still have some demand-related slack
to make up following the crisis, the United States and Japan are growing at
similar rates compared with their growth before the financial crisis after
adjusting for changes to working-age population. Low-income countries
have, on average, seen an increase in growth. The euro area has slowed
relative to pre-crisis rates of growth, with some large emerging markets also
slowing.
A similar pattern emerges in downgrades to the IMF forecasts over
the past five years. Overall, the level of output among G-20 countries is
6-percent smaller in 2015 than what the IMF had predicted in 2010, after
the full extent of the recessions caused by the financial crisis became apparent. Growth over the last five years has fallen short of expectation in 18 of
the 20 G-20 economies, as shown in Figure 3-4, with only Saudi Arabia and
Turkey slightly exceeding expectations, compared with substantial shortfalls
across some other nations. In total, China and India account for about half
of the 6-percent underperformance of the G-20 economy relative to the
2010 projections—with shortfalls in the United States and the European
Union accounting for another one-quarter. The United States accounts for
a sizeable part of the aggregate slowdown despite good growth in GDP per
working-age person and having a relatively small cumulative growth shortfall (just 3.2 percent over the period) because it is such a large share of the

world economy. Likewise, China and India did not underperform as much
as Russia or Brazil, but they make up a larger part of the shortfall because
they are a much more significant part of the world economy.
The persistently disappointing world growth over the last half-decade
has root causes both in longer-term demand and supply. On the supply side,
there has been disappointing labor productivity growth, or the ability to
produce more output from the same labor inputs, across a range of countries
since the crisis. While variable from year to year, G-7 countries had average
labor productivity growth rates near or above 2 percent a year throughout
the latter half of the 20th century. Those rates have all dropped; in some
cases, to near zero. Labor productivity growth for Japan is projected to be a
sixth of its annual rate from 1999 to 2006 and, for the euro area, a third of
its average preceding the financial crisis. Similarly, for most other advanced
economies, labor productivity is projected to be much lower in 2015 than
it was prior to the financial crisis (Conference Board 2015). Productivity
growth in the United States has broadly outperformed other countries with
both a smaller decline from the 1950-2007 period and one of the higher
growth rates in the G-7 at present. Some of the slowdown may simply reflect
a slow global recovery. An important factor in lower productivity growth has
been the decline in the pace of investment per worker—referred to as capital
deepening. To the extent that this represents a cyclical shortfall in demand,

The Global Macroeconomic Situation  |  123

economists would expect capital deepening and productivity growth to pick
up in the coming years.
Sharp and persistent productivity slowdowns are not unprecedented
(Eichengreen, Park, and Shin 2015), but, if sustained, slower productivity growth will mean slower output growth and slower improvements in
living standards. Particularly concerning is the fact that global total factor
productivity (TFP) growth, an indication of innovation above-and-beyond
just deploying more capital, has slowed to roughly zero in the last three years
following pre-crisis rates of 1 percent (Conference Board 2015).
At the same time, the labor force is growing more slowly in the United
States and many other economies around the world. The size of the labor
force, determined both by population changes and movements in the rate at
which people choose to participate in the labor market, provides the other
key supply-side input for overall economic growth. With an aging population and falling labor force participation rates across demographic groups,
the size of the labor force has presented a headwind to U.S. growth, mirrored
to varying degrees across other economies globally (See Box 3-1).
In addition, as noted in Chapter 2, investment has been disappointing in all of the major advanced economies since the financial crisis. This is
worrying from a supply perspective, as there will be a lower capital stock and
possibly lower productivity growth in the future due to reduced investment
today; but it also represents a lack of demand in the world economy. Lower
investment can generally be explained by the slower pace of global recovery,
as faster growth generates more investment demand by firms, but lower
investment also represents lower demand for goods and services itself.
Persistent demand weakness has been visible in many countries. The
unemployment rate has stayed well above pre-crisis averages in many countries and weak price growth has been a signal of a lack of demand pressure
in the economy. Beyond weak investment demand, aggregate demand may
have been persistently weak for reasons related to debt overhang and wealth
loss remaining from the financial crisis. Families, firms, and, in some countries, governments saw a significant run-up in debt prior to the financial
crisis, as well as a loss of wealth from falling asset and home prices and high
levels of insolvency during the crisis itself. Even several years later, they may
hold back on spending and investment as they try to deleverage and rebuild
their balance sheets.
“Secular stagnation,” where chronically insufficient aggregate demand
cannot be remedied by conventional monetary policy, could also play a role
in weak growth in certain economies. Stagnation occurs when even a real
interest rate of zero does not generate enough investment growth to fully
utilize the economy’s resources. A number of features of the economy could
124  |  Chapter 3

Box 3-1: Changing Demographic Trends and Global Growth
Demographics play a large role in the long-run trend of economic
growth by affecting labor supply, capital formation, and productivity
(IMF 2004). A major part of any country’s real GDP growth is simply
its population growth, as growing populations provide more workers as
well as rising demand for products, new homes, and services. Beyond
that, increases in the relative size of the working-age population (people
aged 15 to 64) can also have a major impact on output per capita by
directly changing the labor supply. Demographic changes also indirectly
affect the amount of resources per capita through changes in household
savings behavior across their life cycles. Lower dependency ratios (the
ratio of people younger than 15 or older than 64 to the working-age
population) can raise savings, which helps finance more investments and
increases output. Finally, demographics indirectly affect productivity
growth through changes in the quality of human capital formation and
innovation. Nevertheless, the reverse is also true. Demographic changes
can act as a drag on economic growth (Kohshaka 2013).
Global demographic trends are at a turning point. Population
growth is slowing and, after increasing for the previous five decades,
the proportion of the population that is working-age peaked at 66
percent in 2012. This proportion is projected to decline steadily for the
next century. This slower growth in the working-age population—or
outright contraction—will continue to be a drain on global growth for
the foreseeable future. Stark differences at the country level lie beneath
this global trend. As seen in Figure 3-i, working-age populations are
now shrinking in Europe and in East Asia broadly, not just as a share
of the population, but in raw numbers. In North and Latin America,
working-age populations are projected to flatten out over time, while
Southern Asia and Africa will continue to see an increase. Collectively,
these regional demographic trends signal additional risks to future global
economic growth.
Over the next 30 years, half of the world’s population will live in
Africa and Southern Asia; global population growth will be driven by
their high fertility and relatively young populations. As a result, the bulk
of new workers in the global economy will be added in economies that
have lower levels of education, technology, and capital, implying those
workers will not be as productive, if current circumstances continue. By
2035, the number of people joining the working-age population from
Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia will exceed that from the rest
of the world combined. This means both South Asia and Africa will be
increasingly important to global growth. It will be necessary to build

regions are forecasted to have 73 dependents (people younger than 15 or
older than 64) for every 100 working-age persons.
Aging populations can put pressure on public budgets, with fewer
workers supporting more pensions, and generally supporting slower
growth. These dangers have materialized in Japan. Economic growth
in Japan is stagnant (and forecasted to remain so) in large part because
growth in the working-age population has lagged behind growth in the
total population for the last 20 years (Mühlesisen and Faruqee 2001).
The U.S. economy grew almost twice as fast as Japan’s from 1989 to
2013. However, simply controlling for population by comparing growth
of GDP per capita leads to much more similar growth rates (1.4 percent
versus 1.1 percent). Even more striking is that when examining GDP per
working-age person, Japan had slightly faster growth than the United
States (Figure 3-iii). This highlights that even if a country is doing
reasonably well conditional on its demographics—as Japan has—it still
means slow growth over time if too few workers enter the labor force.
And even if income per capita is rising, slow overall growth due to
slow population growth can greatly increase the challenges associated
with government debt and financing future government commitments
(Karam, Muir, Pereira, and Tuladhar 2011). These issues are now coming to the forefront of the global economy.
Demographics is not just the exogenous result of developments
outside of public policies, it also depends on those policies. In some
countries, for example, pro-natal policies have raised birth rates and

affected the demographic trajectory (Kalwij 2010; Wong, Tang, and
Ye 2011). In the United States, immigration reform would expand the
working-age population and reduce the ratio of children and elderly
relative to prime-age workers. In addition, even for a given demographic
structure, steps that facilitate work and raise the labor force participation
rate will increase economic growth.

lead to this result, ranging from falling population growth that provides
fewer consumers and shifts investment demand to rising inequality that concentrates spending power in the hands of people who have higher propensity
to save. Secular stagnation is likely not an appropriate way to describe the
overall world economy—or the United States—today, but it may be a useful
way to think about some pockets of weakness or risks that could be faced
if the zero lower bound becomes more constraining in dealing with future
recessions. In some countries, like Japan and possibly the euro area, the
combination of a low equilibrium real interest rate, low inflation expectations emanating from weak demand, and unfavorable demographics makes
it very hard for monetary policy alone to stimulate the economy.
The current account balance provides another way to examine relative strengths and weaknesses in demand in the global economy. Countries
that produce more than they consume and invest (net exporters) may have
weaker aggregate demand—more demand-related “slack”—than those
whose demand exceeds production (net importers). Despite substantial
progress in reducing the current account deficit to a 14-year low in 2014, the
United States still runs a larger current account deficit than its sustainability
target as estimated by the IMF (see Figure 3-5); in part, reflecting the relative
strength of U.S. demand compared with the rest of the world. China, Japan,
and the euro area—especially Germany—all have larger current account
surpluses than either their most recent IMF sustainability targets, current
account norms, or both.
In short, various parts of the world economy are growing slowly, and
likely too slowly. U.S. economic performance has clearly been stronger than
the rest of the world and has left it with less demand-related slack in the
economy. Still, the U.S. economy is not a large enough share of the world
economy, nor can it grow fast enough, to solely support world growth. Even
with relatively pessimistic projections for China and emerging markets,
those countries are projected to provide the bulk of growth in the world
economy over the coming decades. If they slow more than expected, global
growth could fall further. 2015, though, has been a difficult year for many
emerging markets (IMF 2014 and 2015d).

Developments in 2015
In contrast to the broader lack of demand affecting the global
economy, 2015 brought a more acute set of challenges for some emerging
markets. Over the past year, countries experiencing the biggest downward
revisions in IMF forecasts were emerging markets and commodity producers; Argentina and India had the only upward revisions among emerging
markets in the G-20. Advanced economies have fared slightly better relative
to forecasts, in part because expectations have not been high. The European
Union and Japan were not expected to grow rapidly and had only small revisions (IMF 2014 and 2015d).

Euro area
Recovery from the financial and sovereign debt crises in the euro
area remained uneven, but gained some momentum in 2015. The euro area
manufacturing sector rebounded in 2015, expanding in December at its
fastest pace in 20 months. In addition, all major euro-area nations experienced positive growth in output and job creation in December for the first
time since April 2014. Domestic demand in the euro area remains below its
pre-crisis peak, driven by weak investment, but growth in real GDP across
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain (GIIPS) as a group increased (see
Figure 3-6), although Greece contracted by 0.8 percent at an annual rate
The Global Macroeconomic Situation  |  129

over the first three quarters of 2015. Nonetheless, the level of output relative
to before the crisis remained much lower for the GIIPS than in the rest of
the euro area—especially Germany. (See Figure 3-6 and Box 2-7 on growth
across advanced economies.)
Unemployment rates tell a similar story: they have improved in the
past year, but many countries in the euro area are still suffering high levels of
joblessness. The unemployment rate fell to 10.4 percent by December 2015
for the euro area as a whole, a full point lower than a year before. The rate
either declined to, or remained within, the low range of 4.5 to 6.1 percent
in Germany, Austria, and Luxembourg. In contrast, it remained above 10
percent in Slovakia; Italy; Portugal; Cyprus; and France, which saw a record
number of jobless workers in October. In Spain and Greece, the unemployment rate was still above 20 percent. This huge range in unemployment rates
across the euro area (from 4.5 percent in Germany to 24.5 percent in Greece)
stands in contrast to the range across U.S. states (from 2.7 percent in North
Dakota to 6.7 percent in New Mexico).
While output expanded in nearly all euro-area countries, weak
domestic investment and demand abroad has weighed down growth in the
euro area. Investment remains subdued in both the GIIPS (as a group) and
Germany as a fraction of GDP relative to other euro-area countries in 2015.
Euro area real GDP growth slowed to 1.2 percent at an annual rate in the
third quarter of 2015, primarily due to a slowdown in export growth.
To some degree, the euro-area economy is still struggling with the vestiges of the euro crisis. Uncertainty over global and regional conditions—for
instance, the path of monetary policy, regional political issues, or foreign
demand conditions—may be one cause of the subdued level of investment.
The Greek situation is one example of such uncertainty. Greece experienced
a sharp upswing in sovereign borrowing rates in the first half of the year
(from around 9 percent in January to a peak of over 18 percent in July) as
failure to implement reforms required by lenders resulted in a lending freeze,
raising tensions that peaked in a referendum in July, where voters rejected
the conditions of international lenders. Fears arose that Greece would have
to exit from the euro area’s currency union when partner countries cut off
credit to banks through the euro system, with Greece imposing strict currency controls and rationing cash withdrawals from banks. However, in late
summer, Greece reached an agreement with euro-area partner countries to
receive additional financing from the European Union. The Syriza government in Greece, under the leadership of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, followed the agreement with domestic votes on economic and fiscal reforms.
The measures calmed investor fears of a Greek exit from the euro area (see
Figure 3-7). Greece’s manufacturing sector remained in a severe downturn

throughout 2015, though its rate of contraction eased late in the year following the resolution of the acute problems in July with financial support from
the European Union, other euro-area members, and accommodations from
the European Central Bank (ECB) coinciding with progress on reforms.
Euro-area inflation was low in 2015, despite the labor market recovery in some countries, further evidence that domestic demand remains
weak. Figure 3-8 shows that euro-area inflation remains well below the
ECB’s goal for the inflation rate of close to but not exceeding 2-percent.
As inflation continued to slow, the ECB increased its monetary stimulus in
2015, purchasing 60 billion euro in sovereign bonds each month (quantitative easing) and lowering a key policy rate of interest to minus 0.3 percent.
Despite the ECB’s additional stimulus, a key challenge remained that
interest rates were highest in countries where unemployment was highest.
The inability to target monetary stimulus limits the ECB’s ability to help
countries with the greatest economic slack and may prevent convergence
across regions. Thus, monetary policy alone is not sufficient to address the
challenge of weak demand.
One reason that the United States has recovered more quickly than
other advanced economies is its combination of accommodative monetary
policy, quick action to recapitalize the financial sector, and aggressive
demand management through countercyclical fiscal policy. In contrast,

some euro-area countries are constrained by fiscal rules and were unable or
unwilling to pursue stronger countercyclical measures. The Federal Reserve
pursued several large-scale asset purchase programs from 2008 to 2014,
dramatically expanding its balance sheet. In contrast, the ECB’s balance
sheet (as measured by the asset side) grew more slowly in the crisis and, after
a brief surge in late 2011 and early 2012, was allowed to contract between
mid-2012 and mid-2014, as euro-area banks repaid the ECB long-term loans
taken out during the crisis. The ECB reversed course and began large-scale
asset purchases in January 2015. Although the ECB voted in December 2015
to extend quantitative easing until at least March 2017 and to augment it
with other measures, markets appeared to have expected more forceful monetary stimulus: the euro jumped 3.1 percent, producing the largest one-day
appreciation of the euro since March 2009.

United Kingdom
Real GDP growth in the United Kingdom has oscillated somewhat
since mid-2014. Real GDP grew 2.2 percent at an annual rate in 2015, down
from 2.9 percent in 2014, which was the highest rate since 2005. U.K. real
GDP in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 14 percent above its trough in the
second quarter of 2009. The labor market recovered further in 2015, with
unemployment falling to 5.1 percent in the three months to November, the
lowest rate in at least 7 years. The slowdown in U.K. GDP growth in the
third quarter was largely accounted for by a large decline in net exports, with
exports declining amidst growth in imports. While the annual rate of core
(excluding energy and unprocessed food) CPI inflation averaged 0.8 percent
below its inflation target, the Bank of England held the policy rate steady
throughout 2015.

Japan
Japan continued to face longstanding economic challenges in 2015,
but experienced some signs of renewal. Japan’s economy contracted in the
second quarter of 2015, but rebounded in the third quarter and the economy
is showing more fundamental signs of longer-term recovery. Periodic recessions have plagued Japan since a financial crisis in 1992 and may, in part,
be a byproduct of the country’s declining population, which weighs on both
potential GDP growth and aggregate demand. When looking at real GDP
per working-age population rather than real GDP, for example, Japan has
recovered from the global financial crisis almost as robustly as the United
States. Japanese real private domestic final purchases (PDFP), which excludes
volatile components of GDP—like net exports, inventories, and government
spending—has been growing (see Box 2-1 in the 2015 Economic Report of
The Global Macroeconomic Situation  |  133

the President for a discussion of the merits of PDFP as a predictive measure
of real activity in the United States). The spring shunto labor negotiations
gave the biggest wage increases since 1998; as a result, real wages have grown
this year. The Japanese economy has grown at an average annual rate of 1.6
percent over the first three quarters of 2015—faster than the average annual
pace of approximately 1 percent experienced over the last five years.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pursued a package of structural
reforms aimed at jumpstarting growth in the Japanese economy, in addition
to campaigning for monetary stimulus and advocating for “flexible” fiscal
policy. To address the economic burdens of a population that is both aging
rapidly and shrinking, the Abe administration has pursued new policies
that have led to an increase in the female labor force participation rate and
the overall share of working-age adults who are employed. Nonetheless,
the aging population presents fiscal challenges and weighs on workforce
participation, weakening domestic demand. To provide further support for
domestic demand, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) expanded its monetary stimulus,
voting various times over the course of 2015 to continue targeting growth in
the money supply at an annual pace of 80 trillion yen (about $660 billion).
Despite these efforts, inflation has fallen precipitously since late 2014, mostly
on declining energy prices, hitting zero in the second half of 2015. While
this raises concerns that the struggle with deflation is not yet over, measures
of inflation that exclude energy are trending upward: the BOJ’s recently
emphasized “alternative core core” inflation metric, which strips out fresh
food and energy, increased from 0.4 percent year-on-year in January to 1.2
percent year-on-year in September, October, and November 2015, closer to
the BOJ’s 2-percent target.

Emerging markets
Buffeted by both global and country-specific factors, many emerging
markets have experienced slowdowns in growth this past year. Emerging
markets generally led world growth coming out of the crisis. They generated
67 percent of world growth from 2010-2014, but just 57 percent of world
growth in 2015, based on IMF estimates. To highlight their importance to
global growth, the World Bank estimates that a 1 percentage-point slowdown
of growth in Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa slows growth in
other emerging-market countries by 0.8 percentage point, in newer frontier
markets by 1.5 percentage points, and global growth by nearly half a percentage point (World Bank 2016). In addition, though, changes in expectations
of growth or financial stability have spilled over into global markets (see Box
3-2 for more discussion of financial spillovers). Often, direct trade linkages
may understate the transmission of shocks if sharp nonlinear contagion
134  |  Chapter 3

takes place in financial markets. At various points in 2015 and early 2016,
financial volatility in China seemed to spill into many markets around the
world.
Real GDP in Brazil and Russia contracted over the first three quarters of 2015. Others, including Indonesia and Malaysia, grew more slowly
between the first and third quarters of 2015 than during the same period
in 2014. In South Korea, growth ticked up slightly, but remained below the
average annual growth of real GDP from 2010 through 2014. Many emerging markets experienced both currency depreciation and declining official
reserves during 2015, especially Malaysia, Turkey, Indonesia, South Africa,
and Russia.
China is in the midst of rebalancing from an investment- and exportdriven economy to an economy driven more by household consumption.
Total (public plus private) investment accounted for 46 percent of GDP by
the end of 2014. This is in contrast to advanced industrialized economies
where total investment accounts for roughly 20 percent of GDP or other
major emerging markets, like Brazil, India, Mexico, South Korea, and South
Africa, where it tends to range between 20 and 30 percent of GDP. Between
2010 and 2014, China’s private consumption share of GDP rose 2.0 percentage points while its investment share of GDP fell 1.4 percentage points,
reflecting a slow shift in the composition of the economy. Rebalancing has
become more a necessity than a choice as a large economy cannot both
grow much faster than the world and be export-led. If it did, it would begin
to crowd out the entire world market. For China to maintain strong growth
and a constant export share of GDP, exports would have to rise from roughly
10 percent of total world exports to as much as half of world exports over the
next 20 years, an unlikely occurrence. Even at a more moderate growth rate,
keeping the same export contribution to growth would require China to take
a very large share of world exports.
Thus, reforms that rebalance growth will be crucial to sustained and
balanced growth in China and the rest of the world. China’s economy is
slowing from double-digit growth rates over the past decade (10 percent, on
average, from 2005 to 2014) to still-rapid but more moderate rates between
6 and 7 percent. According to statistics based on official data, Chinese real
GDP grew 6.9 percent in 2015, down from 7.3 percent in 2014 but close to
the government’s target of 7.0 percent. The extent of slowing in 2015 was
unevenly felt in the economy. While service sector growth has picked up,
consistent with a shift toward more consumption, Figure 3-9 shows various
measures demonstrating slowing across industrial sectors, especially those
related to construction.

Box 3-2: Market Volatility in the Second Half of 2015
Markdowns in expectations for global growth and commodities
prices have at times in 2015 generated substantial swings in global
financial markets. Beyond any direct effects from slower global growth,
some of the potential acute risks for the U.S. economy come through
spillovers from global financial markets. It can be possible for a large
event or change in perceptions—such as an actual shift in policy or an
abrupt rethinking of the growth prospects in a major economy—to shift
investors’ risk sensitivities in a dramatic way. Equity prices across major
markets moved in a highly correlated fashion, on average, in the fall of
2015 and the early weeks of 2016, which could signal that changes in risk
sentiment are moving rapidly from one country to another.
The summer and early fall 2015 were marked by gyrations in
global asset markets. The degree and potential impact of the slowing
of China’s growth rate, uncertainty over changes in advanced-country
monetary policies, the future of Greece’s membership in the euro area,
and the implications of declining commodity prices for commodityproducing countries and firms contributed to unease among investors,
accompanied by market volatility. The VIX, a common measure of
investor uncertainty, spiked in August and September (see Figure 3-iv)
and correlations in equity prices across markets rose.
The period did see a considerable dive in equity prices as investors
reacted strongly to even small changes in emerging data, like U.S. jobs

of countries did finish down for the year, the stock market in the U.S.
finished roughly even, and in Germany and Shanghai finished up on the
year despite the dramatic fluctuations in the summer.
Finance theory suggests that correlation in investor behavior can
occur if investors are focusing on the same economic fundamentals
to decide on trades, or when investors are just more uncertain about
what will happen to economic fundamentals (Scharfstein and Stein
1990; Brunnermeier 2001; Veldkamp 2006 and 2011; Bacchetta and van
Wincoop 2015). Some financial markets exhibited heightened correlation during this period of volatility. This heightened comovement has
occurred again in the early weeks of 2016. It is important to note that
markets are not always correlated and not every shock from abroad
affects U.S. markets. During the substantial run-up of the Chinese equity
market in the spring and then crash in the early summer of 2015, U.S.
equity markets barely moved at all. But, in both late August 2015 and
early January 2016, Chinese, European, and U.S. markets all moved
together (see Figure 3-v). The elevated correlations could have been due
to shocks that have a global reach (exchange rate policy changes in China,
for example), or common shifts in perception (changing views of global
demand or commodity market prospects), but it can also represent spillovers from one market to the next as investors act in a herd-like manner
or losses in one market force asset sales in another. This suggests the

potential for rapid spillovers between even apparently unrelated markets
should investors shift their views more than usual due to an unexpected
piece of news. Swings in global finance and investor attitudes can have
important impacts on the world economy (Borio 2012).
This box surveys recent trends in leverage, commodity prices, and
policy that may relate to the way movements in global growth expectations can feed through into financial markets.
Leverage. Rising leverage—especially in some emerging markets—may have made financial markets fragile right now. Credit growth
enables output growth as it allows consumers, corporations and the
government to borrow against the future GDP, but large expansions of
leverage across many emerging markets leaves them vulnerable to not
just the slower growth that a debt overhang sometimes prompts, but also
to a sharper crash. Surveys of history have found that large credit booms
result in a financial crisis about one-third of the time, and often are followed by a growth slowdown even if there is no crisis (Jorda, Schularick,
and Taylor 2011 and 2013).
An example of how these risks come together is the current degree
of corporate debt in some emerging markets – especially the debt in
foreign currency. The IMF recently labeled it a principal risk in its latest
Global Financial Stability Report. Based on IMF data, emerging market
corporate debt has grown from under 50 percent of GDP prior to the
crisis to nearly 75 percent today. Even in countries with lower overall
leverage, this can be problematic, as particular firms may be overly
indebted, leading to defaults. Even if debt levels are manageable, if their
home currency depreciates against the U.S. dollar (the principal foreign
currency in which there has been borrowing), then the real burden of
that debt rises for these firms, again, pushing them towards bankruptcy
and default. 2015 saw a rise of emerging market corporate defaults and
some key downgrades in sovereign debt ratings.
Still, foreign currency borrowing in emerging markets may not
be as problematic as two decades ago. First, many of the firms that are
borrowing have U.S. dollar revenues because they are exporters. In that
sense, even if their home currency depreciates, they are still earning revenues in dollars and as such can pay their debt. To the extent that these
firms are commodity exporters, they may face problems from reduced
earnings, but the foreign currency borrowing itself may not be the key
risk. In addition, countries overall have much stronger currency balance
sheets than they did two decades ago (Benetrix, Lane, and Shambaugh
2015). Many countries expanded their foreign currency reserves, saw
an increase in private foreign assets, and took more liabilities in local
currency debt, FDI, and equity. These developments may insulate some

138  |  Chapter 3

countries from downside risks in turbulent financial times. This has
helped some emerging markets weather swings in exchange rates that
previously would have involved substantial valuation losses. The IMF
recommended in its January 2016 WEO update that emerging markets,
in particular, continue to build resilience to volatile capital markets.
Commodity Prices and Nonlinear Effects. Many models assume a
supply generated shock to world oil prices is a net positive for the world
economy. Many oil producers, most notably Saudi Arabia, have substantial wealth buffers that smooth their spending across oil price changes,
while oil consumer countries are often more liquidity constrained. But
price declines that are deep enough can cause substantial changes in
global capital expenditures on oil investment, and even deeper price
changes can threaten corporate or sovereign borrowers. In the United
States, eleven oil and natural gas producers with over $500 million in
liabilities filed for bankruptcy in 2015, defaulting on a combined $21.2
billion of debt. This compares to 2014, when only one bankruptcy
involving a firm with more than $500 million in liabilities occurred.
Market expectations of default (measured by CDS spreads) also show
a sharp increase for energy firms, especially those in the United States.
In both August and in December of 2015, oil prices and major
equity markets appeared to take cues from one another. The comovement of oil prices and equity returns may have reflected a common
response to changing expectations of future global growth. However, an
ongoing concern is that oil prices could potentially decline below some
threshold that would result in substantial increased number of bankruptcies by oil producers. Although increased oil-sector bankruptcies would
have some modest negative effects on the economy, the chief risk is that
the resulting oil-sector bond defaults could raise bond investors’ concerns about credit markets more broadly, which in turn would depress
aggregate economic activity. This is an example of nonlinear effects in
asset markets where movements of a price or economic data may be
harmless or even positive for the economy within a certain bound, but
outside that bound, if there are highly leveraged players in the market, it
can have negative effects on financial markets.
Policy. A crucial caveat to the potential financial risks is the extent
to which financial systems are more robust than during financial crises
over the past 20 years. First, U.S. investors do not have large exposure to
emerging market corporate assets. Even with respect to broader volatility, regulations adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act have significantly
reduced the exposure of large financial institutions in the United States
to risk associated with recent bouts of instability in equity and other asset
markets. Financial institutions’ stock of capital serves as a cushion to

The Global Macroeconomic Situation  |  139

absorb unexpectedly high losses. Increased capital requirements under
Dodd-Frank increase the size of this cushion. Measures from the New
York University Volatility Institute suggest banks are better armed to
weather market turbulence than they were even just a few years ago. In
addition, some rules have made it more costly for banks to engage in
speculative trading: the “Volcker Rule” implemented in July also limits
the kinds of risks that banks can take when they invest their stock of
capital before raising alarms with regulators. Finally, some financial
institutions that were previously able to exploit regulatory loopholes
have been brought under the regulatory umbrella.
The rules that have helped push the industry in this direction are
not unique to the United States, but have been part of a broader push in
the Basel III agreement and discussions within the euro area. The designation of crucial global institutions as “globally systematically important
financial institutions” has placed extra capital requirements and rules on
some firms and established resolution authority for these institutions,
making the likelihood that a major failure generates a “Lehman shock”
smaller. It requires great hubris to assume that the financial markets are
bulletproof, but they may now be able to better withstand shocks than a
decade ago.

China’s demand for imports from many trading partners also has
slowed considerably since 2014, such that weakening demand is also being
felt in some global commodity markets where China is an important consumer (see Box 3-3). For instance, according to the World Steel Association,
China accounts for nearly 45 percent of the world’s apparent steel consumption. Estimates based on available data suggest that China’s demand for steel
may have fallen by as much as 30 million tons or more in 2015, an amount
close to 10 percent of total steel exports by the top 10 steel exporters. This
reduced demand for a variety of commodities has had a significant impact
on world markets, as China is a leading export destination for numerous
countries.
China’s currency policies also underwent noteworthy changes in
2015. China maintains a narrow trading band with respect to the U.S dollar. Market pressure forced the renminbi (RMB) toward the weak edge of
its trading band during much of 2014 and the first half of 2015 (see Figure
3-10). On August 11, the People’s Bank of China decided to adopt a new
scheme in determining its reference rate, basing it on the RMB’s previous
closing and allowing a plus or minus a 2 percent trading band, accompanied
by a depreciation of the RMB. This shift came amidst, and may have contributed to, global market volatility in August. Between August 10 and the end of

Box 3-3: Commodity Prices and Inflation in the Global Economy
The drop in commodity prices seen in Figure 3-vi resulted in part
from weakness in the world economy, including slowing demand from
China, which is a large consumer of many commodities in the global
marketplace. The slowdown in the Chinese construction and manufacturing sectors contributed to a drop in demand for commodities that has
been felt worldwide, and some of the most precipitous drops in commodity prices hit during the summer, amid growing market concerns
about China’s economy. Slower global growth has implied lower demand
for various commodities; for example, Figure 3-vii shows that the rise
and fall in world industrial production growth in recent years coincided
with sharp movements in commodity prices. The most-recent significant
drop in commodity prices occurred alongside a relatively small decline
in global industrial production, which suggests that, to some degree, it
is driven by weak demand. Still, the commodity price drop seen in 2015
was much steeper than the fall in industrial production, likely reflecting
shifts in supply or re-evaluations of long-term demand prompted by the
summer’s financial market turbulence. Whatever the underlying reason,
the drop in commodity prices has caused economic turbulence in a
number of commodity-exporters, especially in emerging markets.
The decline also may be contributing to an interesting contrast
in countries’ experiences with inflation. Global inflation in 2015 is on
pace to be at its lowest rate since 2009, and barring 2009, its lowest rate

since at least 1980. Out of the 20 G-20 economies, 8 (including 6 of the
7 G-7 countries) had four-quarter inflation rates below 1 percent in the
third quarter of 2015, and three of them with rates below zero. All of the
world’s major advanced economies had rates below their target. While
advanced economies are confronting the challenge of very low, or even
negative, inflation, some major commodity exporters, like Brazil and
Russia, have faced rapid currency depreciation and high inflation rates;
in part, because currency depreciation makes imported goods more
expensive to domestic consumers. Other emerging markets, like Mexico
and South Africa, where commodity exports are 6 and 11 percent of
GDP, respectively, have also experienced currency depreciation but
lower inflation rates, ranging between 2 and 6 percent, still above those
of a number of European countries, Japan, and the United States.

2015, the cumulative depreciation in the spot rate was 4.6 percent against the
dollar. Since August, the authorities have sold foreign exchange to support
the RMB, as the market was surprised by the sudden depreciation, exchange
rate expectations reset, and private capital outflows continued. The end
of 2015 and start of 2016 has also seen renewed discussion of the value of
the RMB versus a basket of currencies—not just the U.S. dollar—as well as
greater volatility in the exchange rate. Clear communication by China of
its policies and actions to the market as it makes an orderly transition to a
market-determined exchange rate will help guide market expectations.

In November 2015, the IMF voted to include the RMB as the fifth currency used to underpin the IMF Standard Drawing Right (effective October
1, 2016), which globally serves as an important unit of account. Despite
many steps toward financial liberalization and openness, continuing controls on cross-border flows of capital and RMB trading pose many questions
regarding the future path of its integration into the global economy.
Brazil is one of the countries hit hardest by the recent collapse in
commodity prices, in combination with other domestic challenges, with
GDP contracting more than 5 percent at an annual rate over the first three
quarters of 2015. The currency lost roughly a third of its value against the
dollar in the year after December 2014. Although it has fueled domestic
inflation, currency depreciation has generated a rebound in exports (both
in real, local-currency-denominated terms and as a fraction of GDP) and in
the current account in 2015, which narrowed considerably from a deficit of 5
percent to about 3 percent of GDP (see Figure 3-11). The IMF has espoused
flexible exchange-rate regimes like Brazil’s for weathering commodity-price
downturns under fiscal constraints.
As a group, the low-income economies (LICs)—defined as economies with gross national income (GNI) per capita of $1,045 or less by the
World Bank, or a group of 60 countries identified as “low-income” by the
IMF—were a bright spot in global economic growth in recent years. Real
GDP growth in low-income economies had risen from just over 5 percent
on average in the 2001-07 period, to about 6 percent in 2014. However, both
the 2016 World Bank Global Economic Prospects and the IMF report that
GDP growth in LICs fell to between 4.8 and 5.1 percent in 2015. Depending
on how one defines the category, between a half and two-thirds of LICs are
commodity exporters. The commodity price decline is taking a toll on public
finances, current account balances, and economic growth in these countries,
making them more vulnerable to both domestic challenges and external
shocks such as global financial turbulence.
Not every emerging market has seen disappointing growth. India,
for example, experienced strong GDP growth in 2015 with estimates for
growth continuing at roughly 7 percent in 2014, 2015, and 2016 (projected).
India, along with Argentina, were the only G-20 countries estimated to have
grown faster in 2015 than the IMF had predicted a year earlier. Its status
as an important player in service industries, as opposed to commodity or
manufacturing exports, has likely helped its continued growth, and a pickup
in investment may come as a result of recent policy reforms.
Still, the slower growth around the globe has had spillovers to the
U.S. economy. Weaker growth abroad than in the United States tends to put

upward pressure on the U.S. dollar and downward pressure on exports, both
of which were observed in 2015.

U.S. Trade
The U.S. nominal trade deficit in goods and services narrowed slightly
from 3.1 to 3.0 percent of GDP in 2015, as measured in the national income
and product accounts. The trade deficit in levels widened slightly from
$508.3 billion in 2014 to $531.5 billion in 2015 as goods exports fell faster
than goods imports and trade in services remained almost stable, reflecting
the global headwinds discussed above. The trade balance shrank as a share of
GDP as output grew faster, reflecting the strength of the domestic economy
relative to the rest of the world. Figures 3-12 and 3-13 show these balances
calculated according to the balance of payments method. U.S. services
exports continue to grow relative to U.S. goods exports, as they have since
the start of the digital revolution in the 1990s.
Services make up 32 percent of our exports, but only 18 percent of
our imports (see Figures 3-14 and 3-15). Four out of every five American
jobs are in the service sector. The Department of Commerce estimates that
services exports supported 4.6 million U.S. jobs in 2014.

U.S. exports are 12.5 percent of the size of U.S. GDP, much higher
than 10 years ago (see Figure 3-16). They peaked at nearly 14 percent of U.S.
GDP in 2011 and 2013. Until very recently, real exports were consistently
increasing, so the decline demonstrates that our economy is growing faster
than global demand for U.S. goods, another manifestation of the headwinds
discussed above.
Beyond the simple demand component of GDP, exports provide
many benefits to the economy. Exports support nearly 12 million U.S. jobs
according to estimates by the Department of Commerce, a fact that is more
important given that exporters pay as much as 18 percent higher wages,
on average, than non-exporters (see below for more detailed discussion).
Growing exports can help generate productivity growth as higher productivity sectors and firms expand with access to a larger market. This allows them
to employ a higher share of the labor force in these high-productivity firms.
In addition, a rich literature discussed in Chapter 5 documents incentives
that access to global markets give for firms to innovate.
Trade is important both for U.S. firms and for supporting high-paying
jobs. Between mid-2009 and the end of 2015, exports of goods and services
accounted for more than a quarter of U.S. economic growth. As of 2014 (the
most recent data available), more than 300,000 U.S. companies were engaged
in exporting, the vast majority of them small and medium-sized businesses.
Research published by the U.S. Census Bureau illustrates the strikingly
high-quality jobs these companies support. Non-exporting firms employed
an average of 13 workers apiece at payrolls averaging $34,814 per worker
while exporting firms employed an average of 243 workers each at payrolls
averaging $51,302 per worker (Census 2012). Other research by Riker (2010)
and Riker and Thurner (2011) confirms the existence of an exporter wage
premium, showing that workers at exporting firms earn up to 18 percent
more, on average, than non-exporting firms. Riker (2015) provides updated
estimates in a similar range, with exporting firms paying premiums of up
to 19 percent for blue collar workers, and 12 percent for white collar workers. Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal (2014) estimate that trade openness has
increased the purchasing power of American consumers in a progressive
way. According to their calculations, households in the lowest third of the
income distribution gain more than half of their purchasing power from
U.S trade and middle-income households gain more than a quarter of their
purchasing power from U.S. trade. See Box 5-4 for a further discussion on
how trade can promote innovation and economic growth. About half of U.S.
exports go to emerging markets, demonstrating our interdependence with
economies that have increasingly experienced challenges to growth during
2015 (see Figure 3-17).

Box 3-4: The Importance of the Trans-Pacific
Partnership (TPP) for the U.S. Economy
The complicated global economic environment underscores the
importance of the President’s trade agenda in opening new markets
and ensuring a level playing field for U.S. firms. The centerpiece of
that agenda is the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a comprehensive
and high-standard trade agreement with 11 other countries—including
3 of the United States’ 5 largest trading partners—in one of the most
dynamic, fastest-growing regions of the world. With 45 percent of the
$726.5 billion in U.S. exports of goods and 25 percent of the $178.3 billion in U.S. exports of services going to TPP countries in 2014, no previous free trade agreement has covered such a large share of U.S. trade.
U.S. exports to TPP countries supported an estimated 4.2 million U.S.
jobs in 2014, more than a third of the 11.7 million U.S. jobs supported
by exports to the world.
The TPP will make it much easier to sell American goods and
services to this rapidly growing market. It will eliminate over 18,000
tariffs on U.S. goods exports. It locks in zero-tariffs on 98 percent of
goods traded, not just eliminating tariffs but ridding businesses of the
uncertainty that tariffs might suddenly rise in a market they serve. For
example, tariffs up to 59 percent on machinery and up to 32 percent
on fresh fruit, industries where it can take time between investing in
expanded capacity and when producers start earning revenues, would be
phased out or eliminated, enabling producers to invest upfront without
worrying that tariffs might later arbitrarily be revived. It promotes
expanded digital and services trade with safeguards for privacy and security. It makes important strides to help small- and medium-sized businesses, including streamlining trade barriers like complicated standards
and technical regulations, which make it hard for small businesses to
access new markets, providing only one set of rules to export their goods
rather than separate standards for each of the 11 countries. It reduces a
slew of customs frictions, allowing e-filing of customs forms and advance
valuation and ensuring that goods can pass through ports expediently,
with special provisions for the express deliveries so important to many
smaller firms.
Under the TPP, the United States will help set the standards for free
and fair trade in the Pacific Basin. The TPP is part of a new generation
of agreements, going further than any prior agreement to advance the
wellbeing of workers and firms in the United States and the region as
a whole. Under TPP, partners have agreed to adhere to labor standards
of the International Labor Organization, including the right to unionize
and commitments to enforce prohibitions on child and forced labor. For

150  |  Chapter 3

instance, Vietnam’s and Malaysia’s workers will for the first time gain
the freedom to form independent unions, lifting decades-old restrictions. TPP will also require Malaysia to fully implement recently passed
amendments to the country’s Anti-Trafficking law, taking an important
step to address human trafficking issues. The TPP has enforceable provisions to prevent illegal wildlife trafficking, discourage subsidy programs
that increase pressure on fisheries stocks, and help prevent illegal logging. The labor and environmental standards will be enforceable with
dispute settlement and trade sanctions, if necessary, helping improve
quality of life in the region and avoid unfair competition. In dispute
settlement, it offers improved transparency, includes opportunities for
public comment in dispute settlement, and reaffirms each country’s
right to regulate in the public interest for national security, health, safety,
financial stability, and environmental reasons. It levels the playing field
with strong rules to help make sure that governments cannot give unfair
advantages to their state-owned enterprises and companies cannot gain
a competitive advantage by undermining worker protections and environmental regulations, which is a high risk if trade integration continues
in the region without U.S. involvement.
Research suggests substantial positive impacts on both U.S. exports
and incomes if TPP is put into force. One prominent study by Petri and
Plummer (2016) from the Peterson Institute predicts a significant gain
for the United States—an additional 0.5 percent in real annual income,
with the majority of the benefit going to labor in the form of higher
wages—including an expansion of U.S exports by more than 9 percent
relative to a world without the agreement. It also predicts large gains
for even the poorest among the TPP countries. Although the authors
note that tariff reductions were more ambitious than many anticipated,
roughly half of the economic benefits arise from reductions in non-tariff
barriers. Another study released recently by the World Bank concurs that
TPP would deliver significant benefits to the U.S. economy, boosting
income and exports by tens of billions relative to a world without TPP.
Delay or failure to implement TPP risks substantial costs. Exporters
may watch new opportunities to expand delayed or missed, a cost which
Petri and Plummer (2016) estimate to be $94 billion if implementation
is delayed by even just one year. At the same time, China, the European
Union, Japan, and other economies are negotiating preferential agreements whose effect in the absence of TPP would be to create or exacerbate tariff differentials that put U.S. exports at risk and may reduce
incentives for goods-producing industries to invest in the United States.

The Global Macroeconomic Situation  |  151

The challenging environment for U.S. exports is an important
motivation for the President’s trade agenda, including the Trans-Pacific
Partnership agreement, which was closed in October and submitted to
Congress soon afterward (discussed in Box 3-4, as well as in Chapters 1 and
5), and the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership negotiations
currently in progress, as well as a number of other initiatives.

Conclusion
Slower global growth in 2015 was both a product of longer-term
supply—slower productivity growth and slowing labor force growth—and
demand factors—weak investment growth and longer-term demand slowdowns. In addition, though, continued cyclical weakness in many areas of
the world combined with a sharp emerging-market slowdown produced
the slowest global growth rate since the recovery from the global financial
crisis began. The United States has been a relative bright spot in the world
economy, gradually approaching full employment levels of output and
generating substantial portions of global demand. It will be crucial that the
world economy not return to a model prevailing prior to the crisis where too
much of the global economy relied on the U.S. consumer. Still, forecasts are
for these global headwinds to continue to weigh on U.S. growth in the near
future—which is why both strengthening the U.S. economy to ensure it is
more resilient while working with partners abroad on their growth is a key
priority for the President.

INEQUALITY IN EARLY
CHILDHOOD AND EFFECTIVE
PUBLIC POLICY INTERVENTIONS
Introduction

E

conomic research has established that investments in children’s health,
education, nutrition, and income support have large benefits both for
individuals and for society as a whole. For example, public provision of K-12
education has long been viewed as essential for promoting equality of opportunity and for fostering a productive workforce. More recently, however,
research has shown the critical importance of investments made in the years
before children enter school.
Many measures of abilities and skills that contribute to future productivity—referred to by economists as “human capital”—were once considered
by many to be hereditary. Yet a growing body of research at the intersection
of economics, neuroscience, and developmental psychology has shown that
early indicators of a child’s potential are often highly responsive to changes
in environment and to the actions of parents and caregivers. In turn,
improvements or deficits in early investments can perpetuate themselves, in
part by enhancing or reducing the efficacy of later childhood investments.
Indeed, at the time of school entry, the characteristics of a child and his or
her family explain much of the variation in later educational achievement,
and even in subsequent earnings and employment. Further, gaps that exist
at school entry tend to remain stable or even widen as children progress
through school.
The persistence of these early childhood disparities has profound consequences for the life chances of those born into poverty and disadvantage.
Comparisons of early health and human capital measures across different
groups in society reveal large gaps by household income and by race/ethnicity, geography, and family structure. These gaps are mirrored by gaps in a
variety of parental characteristics and inputs, as well as by differences in the
153

child’s environment. Despite the high potential returns, many families lack
the resources, time, and opportunities to make essential early investments
in their children.
Opportunity gaps among young children have important implications
for public policy. Researchers have studied a broad set of policies that provide investment in early childhood and found significant and wide-ranging
benefits for parents and children.1 Public investment that improves the
inputs in a child’s early years can help to close critical achievement, health,
and development gaps, and can lead to benefits such as higher earnings that
accumulate over a lifetime. In fact, some researchers argue that closing the
gaps in early childhood is the easiest and most cost-effective way to reduce
inequality in later-life outcomes.2 Closing these gaps is not just about education, but also about more broadly alleviating the budget constraints facing
families of younger children.
Importantly, the benefits of early investment accrue not only to individual children and their families, but also to society. The public benefits
include: higher tax revenue from a more productive workforce; lower rates
of criminal activity; reduced inequality; and reductions in public spending
on medical care, remedial education,3 incarceration, and transfer programs.
This chapter surveys the research on the benefits of early childhood
investment, with an emphasis on the role of public policy. The first part of
the chapter begins with an overview of the main theories explaining why
early investments may have especially high returns. It then presents evidence
on the early appearance of large gaps by socioeconomic status (SES)—
including gaps in measures of early health and human capital, in a variety
of parental characteristics and inputs, and in other environmental factors.
The first part concludes by presenting the main economic arguments on
why government policy is crucial to ensuring an optimal level of investment
in early childhood, especially for children from disadvantaged households.
In the second part, the chapter surveys existing Federal policies and
programs that invest in early childhood health, development, and education
and reviews the most rigorous research on the impacts of these policies on
children’s short- and long-run outcomes. The broad range of policies and
programs considered here operate through multiple mechanisms. These
include: direct investments in early education such as high-quality child care
1 Chapter Four of the 2015 Economic Report of the President, “The Economics of FamilyFriendly Workplace Policies,” and CEA’s January 2015 report “The Economics of Early
Childhood Investment” discuss the benefits that early childhood education can have for
parents. This chapter focuses on the benefits for children.

and preschool; direct investments in health such as children’s health insurance and home visitation to help new parents keep infants healthy; nutrition
programs that supplement families’ food budgets; and income transfers
and other near-cash transfer programs that offer more flexible assistance to
low-income families. This overview analyzes the benefits to the individual
and to the public and assesses the role of policy in promoting economic
opportunity for all children.

The Economics of Investing Early and the
Consequences of Early Life Disadvantage
Pathways for Returns to Early Investments
Researchers have outlined several theories that help explain why early
childhood is a particularly important time to invest in children. First, investments made when children are very young will generate returns that accrue
over a child’s entire life. Since the benefits are realized over a longer time
horizon, the earlier in life they are made, the more likely early childhood
interventions are to generate substantial benefits—both to the child and to
his or her community.4
A second reason that early childhood investments benefit children’s
development may be that the flexibility and capacity for change in cognitive
functioning and brain development is the greatest for young children, and
these changes can have lasting effects on behavior throughout life (Knudsen
et al. 2006). Research shows that characteristics that are often assumed to be
innate, like cognitive skills, can be influenced by environmental factors in
early childhood (Jensen 1980; National Scientific Council on the Developing
Child 2007). Under this model, not only do earlier investments generate
benefits over a longer time period, but also each dollar invested produces
greater impacts since children’s brains are developing most rapidly when
they are young.
Related developmental theories imply that a child’s environment in
utero has a large impact on the health of the child and indicate that even
investments made before birth can have long-lasting consequences. The
“fetal origins hypothesis” posits that adverse conditions in the womb can
strongly influence whether a child develops metabolic issues such as diabetes
and heart disease throughout their lives (Currie and Rossin-Slater 2015)
and can even translate beyond physical health to mental health (Persson
4 This is a central tenet of the human capital model in economics; see Becker (1962) and BenPorath (1967).

Inequality in Early Childhood and Effective Public Policy Interventions   |  155

and Rossin-Slater 2015).5 These adverse conditions can also affect cognitive
and economic outcomes, including test scores, educational attainment, and
income (Almond and Currie 2011; Lavy, Schlosser, and Shany 2016). The
academic literature on the long-term health impacts of stress and nutrition
in utero provides support for this theory, and support for intervening even
before birth.
Third, early investments can have large impacts if early skills serve as
a multiplier, or prerequisite, for later skills (Cunha et al. 2006; Cunha and
Heckman 2007). For example, it may be that the extent of skill acquisition
in early elementary school depends on the degree of skills attained before
entering kindergarten, and skills learned in adolescence depend on mastery
of these elementary skills. Under this “skill-begets-skill” model, early investments in child development can enhance the productivity of future investments in human capital. Since early education may serve as a complement
for later skills gained in high-quality elementary and later education, it is
important to reinforce children’s learning throughout their schooling years
to maximize the benefits of early education. A continuum of high-quality
education ensures that early investments can be strengthened and built upon
in later years (Currie and Thomas 2000).
These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, as there is evidence to
support each, and they may work together to produce the large benefits of
early investments.

Inequality in Early Health and Human Capital Investments
Comparisons of early health and human capital measures across different groups in American society reveal large gaps by household income
and by race/ethnicity and family structure. On nearly every measure of
school readiness, children born into low-income households enter school at
a substantial disadvantage relative to their higher-income peers. For example, Figure 4-1 shows that income-based gaps in math skills, attention, and
social skills are well-established by kindergarten and that these achievement
gaps persist (and, if anything, tend to widen) through fifth grade.
The barriers faced by young people who grow up in disadvantaged
settings are compounded over time and may be exacerbated by unequal
treatment in the educational and disciplinary systems later in childhood.
By the time youth who have experienced these challenges reach adulthood,
5 See also the large epidemiological literature connecting in utero exposure to famine and
the onset of mental illness (Susserr and Lin 1992; Susser et al. 1996; Neugebauer et al. 1999;
McClellan et al. 2006), and evidence that mental illness can be traced to brain abnormalities
that may be related to fetal environment (Berquin et al. 1998; Stoner et al. 2014; Liu et al.
2012).

they are less likely to have the educational attainment and labor market skills
critical to success in today’s economy. As a result, they tend to participate
less often in the labor force, experience higher rates of unemployment when
they do participate, and earn less when they find work.
Recent research on the intergenerational transmission of wealth
suggests that the close connection between family resources and children’s
adult outcomes is in large part due to differences in environment rather
than genetics (Black et al. 2015). Research also points to specific pathways
through which poverty can be detrimental for young children’s immediate
and long-run outcomes, including inequality in resources directed toward
building human capital. Growing up with a lack of familial resources means
there are simply fewer resources available to support health and education. In addition to restricted monetary investment due simply to a lack of
resources, several other factors associated with poverty—such as low parental health and human capital, food insecurity, stress, and neighborhood
factors like school quality—can have negative impacts on children’s physical
and mental health, cognition, and socio-emotional and behavioral skills.
This section examines the evidence on gaps in early childhood health,
as measured by birth weight and other physical health indicators, and in
early human capital measures, including both “cognitive skills,” as measured by school achievement, and “non-cognitive skills,” as measured by
socio-emotional and behavioral skills. Research has demonstrated that these

measures are both mutable and strong predictors of long-run outcomes.
Evidence is also presented on the parallel gaps in a variety of parental characteristics and inputs as well as other characteristics of children’s environments that likely contribute to the gaps in early outcomes.
Here and throughout this chapter, the focus is on income-based gaps
and disadvantages associated with poverty. While poverty is strictly defined
in terms of income, it is important to note that poverty can also serve as a
proxy for many other forms of disadvantage that may also stifle investment
in early childhood. Poverty is unevenly distributed by race/ethnicity and
family structure. In 2014, 15.5 million children lived in poverty in the United
States—an overall child poverty rate of 21 percent. But youth of color were
disproportionately impoverished, including 37 percent of African-American
youth and 32 percent of Hispanic youth. Young children of single mothers
were also disproportionately impoverished, with over one-half of all related
children under age 6 in households headed by a female in poverty (Census
Bureau 2015).
Finally, as Figure 4-2 shows, children whose households are headed by
individuals who are non-White, less-educated, and/or single are especially
likely to experience poverty; as a result, they are more likely to experience
deficits in early health and human capital inputs and in later-life outcomes.

Disparities in Early Health
Prenatal, neonatal, and post-neonatal health (through the first year
of life) are crucial early determinants of later-in-life health and academic
success. Good health and nutritional baselines are directly linked to better
health in childhood. Early health outcomes carry over into adult health outcomes and even connect to non-health outcomes such as cognition, which
can continue into adulthood. Even before birth, children born into lower
socioeconomic status households face disadvantages in the area of health.
Individuals of lower socioeconomic status experience higher levels of
stress than more advantaged individuals. As such, the link between maternal
stress and child physical and mental health outcomes puts children born
into poorer households at higher risk of adverse health outcomes (Persson
and Rossin-Slater 2015; Thompson 2014; Kunz-Ebrecht et al. 2004; Cohen
et al. 2006; Aizer, Stroud, and Buka 2012). Health disadvantages continue
throughout children’s earliest years in the form of food insecurity, stress,
and cognitive overload (an accumulation of concerns to the point that
the stress becomes overwhelming and impairs cognitive functioning). The
stress and concerns associated with living in poverty can affect cognition
and health into adulthood. Children born to lower-income mothers are also
less likely to receive early and adequate prenatal care. Rates of first trimester
prenatal care increase with educational attainment, from only 58 percent of
mothers with less than a high school diploma to 86 percent of mothers with a
bachelor’s degree or higher (Health Resources and Services Administration
2013). 
As a result of exposure to these adverse early childhood health conditions, children growing up in poverty may experience more physical and
mental health problems throughout their lives. Researchers have shown
that maternal stress during pregnancy depresses birth weight (Persson and
Rossin-Slater 2015; Black, Devereux, and Salvanes 2016) and can increase
the risk of hospitalizations in the first five years of life (Persson and RossinSlater 2015). The impacts of maternal stress during pregnancy can even be
traced to educational attainment (Aizer, Stroud, and Buka 2012) and adult
mental health (Persson and Rossin-Slater 2015).
Children growing up in poverty tend to do worse across a spectrum
of important early health outcomes. They are nearly twice as likely to be
born at a low or very low birth weight and are four times more likely to
have poor overall physical health (Figure 4-3). Birth weight is one early
indicator of health that can be highly predictive of later-life success. Studies
of birth weight find that it is not only a good predictor of short-term health
and mortality, but also of longer-term health and human capital variables,

including school achievement and earnings (Black, Devereux, and Salvanes
2007; Figlio et al. 2014).
Poor children are also much more likely to experience food insecurity,
or the lack of resources necessary for consistent and dependable access to
food, which can compromise early nutrition and lead to worse short- and
long-term outcomes. Overall, about 19 percent of households with children,
including 15 million children, experienced food insecurity in 2014 (ColemanJensen et al. 2015). Rates of food insecurity are much higher among certain
vulnerable populations, including poor households and households headed
by single women and minorities (Figure 4-4). Food security and access to
good nutrition are critical in utero and in the early years of life, setting up
a child for physical and mental health throughout their lives. For example,
the type of nutrition young children receive can shape the architecture of
the brain and central nervous system in a variety of ways (Georgieff 2007;
Rosales, Reznick, and Ziesel 2009). Maternal malnutrition can impair fetal
development, with effects that carry into childhood and adulthood physical
and mental health (Almond and Mazumder 2011; Adhvaryu et al. 2014).6
Parental and child stress can also be contributors to inferior mental
and physical health outcomes for poor children. Parents living in poverty
are more likely to experience cognitive overload, meaning that the stress

and concerns associated with living in poverty can become overwhelming to
the point that it affects cognitive functioning, which can further perpetuate
poverty (Mani et al 2013). Mothers living in poverty are also more likely to
be depressed and in poor health, and to smoke during pregnancy (Figure
4-5). When children live in poverty, they may also experience chronic stress
and cognitive overload, which can harm cognition in adulthood (Evans
and Schamberg 2009). Children in poor households are disproportionately
likely to be exposed to adverse childhood experiences, including neglect and
abuse, which can lead to poorer health and human capital outcomes later in
life (Hillis et al. 2004; Felitti et al. 1998; Campbell, Walker, and Egede 2015;
Flaherty et al. 2013). All of these differential inputs and experiences contribute to gaps in early physical and mental health.

Disparities in Early Human Capital
Insufficient family financial and non-financial resources mean that
children from low-income families are less likely to have access to activities
and materials that promote learning and wellness, such as high-quality early
education and enriching home environments. These factors, and others
associated with poverty (such as higher health risks, food insecurity, and
increased stress) contribute to the disparities between these children and
their higher-income peers in school readiness. In turn, the disadvantage

these children face upon school entry has long-lasting consequences for academic achievement and behavior throughout their schooling years (Duncan,
Magnuson, and Votruba-Drzal 2014; Duncan, Ziol-Guest, and Kalil 2010).
A child’s early years, beginning in infancy, are a period of profound advances in reasoning, language acquisition, and problem solving.
Importantly, a child’s environment can dramatically influence the degree
and pace of these advances. By supporting development when children
are very young, early childhood development and education programs can
complement parental investments. Children who enter school at higher
levels of readiness have higher earnings throughout their lives. They are also
healthier and less likely to become involved with the criminal justice system.
Early Gaps in Cognitive and Non-Cognitive Outcomes
Socioeconomic disparities in cognitive, social, behavioral, and health
outcomes are evident in children as young as 9 months of age and these gaps
tend to widen as children grow older. At just 9 months, infants and toddlers
from low-income families score lower on cognitive assessments, are less
likely to be in excellent or good health, and are less likely to receive positive
behavior ratings than their counterparts from higher-income families; by 24
months, the cognitive and behavioral gaps have at least doubled (Halle et
al. 2009). By the time children enter school around age 5, children in poor
households are nearly 4 times more likely to score “very low” on assessments

of math skills and over 4 times more likely to score “very low”’ on reading
skills than children in more well-off households (Figure 4-6).
These gaps tend to follow children throughout their school careers,
putting impoverished children at a substantial academic disadvantage that
can be hard to overcome. As shown in Figure 4-7, most of the income
achievement gap emerges before age 5, and it remains relatively constant
through the beginning of high school—suggesting that achievement gaps in
later years are established in the earliest years of childhood. Some researchers argue that these gaps have grown over the past 50 years as overall income
inequality has grown, and as the relationship between income and achievement has become stronger (Reardon 2011).7 Family income is an increasingly important determinant of children’s future earnings, suggesting that
parental income inequality can have a long-run impact on educational and
labor market inequality as their children age (Duncan, Kalil, and Ziol-Guest
2015).
Children experiencing poverty are also more likely to exhibit behavioral problems and to perform worse on non-cognitive skills tests. As shown
in Figure 4-8, at age 5, children in poor households are nearly 80 percent
7 There is some disagreement on the comparability of achievement gaps across studies over
time. While some studies suggest gaps in test scores across socioeconomic groups stabilize
from primary school (Reardon 2011; Heckman 2006), others argue that differences in academic
achievement based on standardized test scores are not comparable over time (Nielsen 2015).

more likely to exhibit learning-related behavioral issues, such as not paying
attention in class, and more than 50 percent more likely to exhibit externalizing behavioral problems. These findings are likely attributable to a host
of stressors that these children face, including less-safe neighborhoods,
increased exposure to trauma, insufficient resources to address their physical and mental health needs, and having parents with unmet physical or
mental health needs.
In addition to cognitive skills, non-cognitive skills, or socio-emotional
and behavioral skills, are also strong predictors of educational attainment,
and therefore of longer-term human capital accumulation, employment,
and wages. For example, teacher-rated social adjustment is a strong predictor of educational attainment and employment (Carneiro, Crawford,
and Goodman 2007). Social and behavioral skills in childhood have also
been shown to be strong predictors of physical health and engagement
in risky behaviors later in life. Indeed, non-cognitive factors can be even
stronger predictors than cognitive factors of risky behaviors and their
consequences—including smoking, participation in illegal activity, and
incarceration (Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua 2006). This means that children from disadvantaged backgrounds who have had less support in their
socio-emotional and behavioral development from their earliest years are at
a higher risk of engaging in unhealthy and harmful behavior.

Gaps in Resource and Time Investment
As discussed above, these large gaps in cognitive and non-cognitive
skills may be due in part to large differences in inputs, including both
parental inputs and formal, high-quality early learning opportunities.
Today, inequalities in parental inputs such as time, resources, earnings, and
education are higher than in the past. Parents in the top fifth of income
earners now spend seven times more on enrichment activities and materials
for their children—such as books, computers, summer camps, and music
lessons—than families in the bottom fifth (Duncan and Murnane 2011).
Moreover, as income inequality has grown, so has inequality in child-related
expenditures.
Higher-income parents generally have more time to spend with their
children, and the amount of time they spend has been increasing at a faster
rate than among lower-income parents (Figure 4-9).8 This may reflect, in
part, that higher-income workers are much more likely to have access to
paid time off and workplace flexibility, which they can use to spend quality
time with young children (CEA 2015b). This additional time, particularly
time spent playing and engaging in a child’s development, is important for
early cognitive and socio-emotional development. For example, research
demonstrates that reading to children is crucial for early language acquisi8 See Ramey and Ramey (2010) and Bianchi (2010) for further details.

tion and communication skills (National Research Council and Institute of
Medicine 2000; Tamis-LeMonda et al. 2004). This inequality during early
childhood creates an income-based advantage in educational outcomes early
in life and leads to inequality in adult outcomes, one reason suggested for the
persistence of income levels across generations (Solon 1992). For instance,
when mothers obtain more education, it improves birth outcomes for their
children (Currie and Moretti 2003). This may be due to the increases in
marriage, use of prenatal care, lower fertility, reduction in smoking, or other
factors that are correlated with higher levels of maternal education.
The gap is also reflected in the total time spent with children and in
activities that engage children. In particular, high-income parents spend
more time on educational activities with their children (Figure 4-10), creating an income-based advantage in educational outcomes in the first few
years of life.
Highly educated parents are also spending more time on child-care
activities, such as playing with young children and helping with children’s
activities (Ramey and Ramey 2010). For example, highly educated parents
spend more time on developing their children’s reading and problem-solving skills in preschool, and on extra-curricular activities for older children
(Kalil 2014). In contrast, less-educated parents are less likely to adapt their
time-use patterns with children to developmental stages (Kalil, Ryan, and
Corey 2012). Gaps in children’s vocabulary can reflect these differences in

time use by parents’ educational attainment: highly educated mothers tend
to engage in more complex talk with their children and spend more time
reading and, at 3 years old, their children have more expansive vocabularies
than children with less exposure to books and language (Vernon-Feagans et
al. 2015).
These disparities in early childhood development can be exacerbated
by later gaps in formal early schooling opportunities, as demonstrated by an
extensive literature on the positive impacts of preschool on cognitive and
non-cognitive outcomes. Children’s enrollment in formal learning environments is especially affected by socioeconomic status. About 60 percent
of 3- and 4-year olds whose mothers have a college degree are enrolled in
preschool, compared to about 40 percent of children whose mothers did
not complete high school (Figure 4-11). Although preschool attendance has
increased for all maternal education groups since the 1970s, children of lesseducated mothers are still less likely to attend preschool, in part due to the
significant cost burden of high-quality early childhood care. Lower-income
families are less likely to be able to afford care: among families with childcare expenses and working mothers, families below the Federal Poverty
Level pay an average of 30 percent of their income in child-care costs, compared with 8 percent among non-poor families (Laughlin 2013).
Since formal early childhood education is less affordable for children who grow up in disadvantaged settings, inequalities in achievement

that appear within the first few years of life continue to grow as children
from disadvantaged families fall behind. Federal, State, and local programs
help fill the socioeconomic status gap in the availability of early childhood
education. For example, Head Start and Early Head Start provide formal
high-quality learning environments for children from low-income families.

Gaps in Quality of Environmental & Neighborhood Factors
Around 4 million poor children grow up in high-poverty neighborhoods (Rawlings 2015). The health and human capital inputs that are available to poor children because of where they live are considerably worse than
those available to children in more advantaged neighborhoods. A large body
of literature confirms that neighborhood characteristics, such as accessibility
and quality of learning, social and recreational activities, support networks,
and the presence of physical risk (such as violence, victimization, and harmful substances), affect later-life outcomes (Leventhal and Brooks-Gunn
2000).
For example, school quality varies enormously with the level of poverty in a neighborhood. Access to high-quality schools with good teachers
has been proven to improve later-life outcomes, such as earnings potential
(Chetty, Rockoff, and Friedman 2014). However, because most public
schools serve students within attendance district boundaries, children from
low-income neighborhoods often lack access to high-quality schooling.

168  |  Chapter 4

Black (1999) shows that school quality is capitalized in housing prices,
meaning that houses in neighborhoods assigned to high-quality schools
may be too expensive for low-income families to afford. Moreover, students
in high-poverty school districts too often receive less investment than
their peers in low-poverty districts, since local revenues account for a large
fraction of school revenue (45 percent in 2011-2012) (National Center for
Education Statistics 2015). In 23 States, districts serving the highest percentage of students from low-income families are spending fewer State and local
dollars per pupil than districts that have fewer students in poverty (U.S.
Department of Education 2015).
In addition to inadequate resources and support and the voluntary
nature of the early childhood system, differential expulsion and suspension
can also reduce disadvantaged students’ access to early learning. Children
from disadvantaged backgrounds may face biases that create barriers to
their education, especially since children of color are overrepresented in
low-income populations. For example, children of color, particularly boys
are much more likely to be suspended or expelled from early learning settings (see Box 4-1 for further discussion of differential outcomes by gender
in early childhood). In 2011-12, African-American students represented 18
percent of preschool enrollment but 48 percent of preschoolers suspended
more than once (Office for Civil Rights 2014). This type of discipline can
detract from learning, especially when children are removed from school
and temporarily denied a formal learning environment.
Although traditional neighborhood school quality can be lacking
in disadvantaged areas, there may be opportunities for government intervention to address barriers to quality schooling in these neighborhoods.
Research shows that policies to expand disadvantaged students’ access to
quality schooling, like busing or charter schools, can improve educational
attainment and close achievement gaps (Billings, Deming, and Rockoff
2014; Dobbie and Fryer 2011). Additionally, traditional public schools see
marked improvement when they adopt best practices identified in alternative schooling policies. A study by Fryer (2014) shows that public schools in
Houston experienced sizeable increases in student math achievement of 0.15
to 0.18 standard deviations per year when they adopted five best practices
from charter schools.
Other characteristics of low-income neighborhoods can also inhibit
healthy child development. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) reports that children living at or below the poverty line who inhabit
older housing are at greatest risk for lead poisoning, which impairs brain
development. Although much progress has been made in reducing rates
of poisoning (CDC 2015), the effects of lead persist through a child’s life.

Box 4-1: Gender Differences in Early Outcomes
and Responses to Investment
Early investments are critical for both boys and girls, but parental
and environmental inputs can differ for children of different genders,
leading to disparate outcomes. Boys in low-income households tend to
do worse on a myriad of health and human capital outcomes than similarly situated girls, ranging from educational attainment to test scores to
crime involvement (Autor et al. 2015). A new working paper by Chetty
et al. (2016) shows that these gender gaps in the impact of childhood
disadvantage may be sustained through adulthood. Men who grew up
in high-poverty, high-minority areas work significantly less than women
from similar backgrounds, with the worst outcomes concentrated among
men who grew up in low-income, single-parent households.
Researchers have found that environmental, rather than biological,
factors drive this relationship. Autor et al. (2015) show that, though
children born into families of low socioeconomic status (SES) have worse
health than higher-SES newborns, birth outcomes are similar between
low-SES siblings of different genders. The authors suggest that the gaps
that emerge between low-SES male and female siblings later in childhood
are due to differences in their environment after birth, or differential
response to that environment.
Influences from both inside and outside of the home environment may lead both genders to be more sensitive to certain aspects of
disadvantaged upbringing. Autor et al. (2015) suggest that gender gaps
in outcomes between low-SES siblings, where boys tend to do worse, are
related to home environment, partially through a lack of same-sex role
models (fathers are more likely to be absent than mothers) and relatively
smaller parental time investments as a result. They also posit that factors
outside of the home but that are associated with low-SES status, including worse schools and neighborhoods, can have disproportionately
negative impacts on boys. For example, a new working paper by the
same authors shows that males on average benefit more from cumulative
exposure to high-quality schools than their female siblings (Autor et al.
2016). Additionally, the stress associated with poverty appears to have
more serious effects on males than on females (Bertrand and Pan 2013).
This may be in part because boys’ coping strategies tend to involve more
aggressive behavior and less interaction with prosocial adults (Coleman
and Hendry 1999). These differences in coping strategy may lead to different outcomes for the genders in different types of early intervention.
As a consequence, the effects of policies that support investment
in children may vary for girls and boys. The policy section of this
chapter examines how and why program impacts may differ by gender.

170  |  Chapter 4

Differences in early life investments and adaptation behaviors between
genders can affect the efficacy of childhood policy interventions. These
disparities not only highlight the complexities in childhood development,
but also the need to invest early. The earlier an intervention occurs, the
fewer baseline gaps and maladaptive behaviors there are to overcome.

Besides diminished cognitive function, lead poisoning can manifest in
behavioral problems as a child, pregnancy and aggression as a teen, and
criminal behavior as a young adult (Reyes 2015a,b). Children from lowsocioeconomic-status families are also more likely to be exposed to higher
levels of pollution in their neighborhoods, making them more likely to be
hospitalized with asthma complications (Neidell 2004). Exposure to pollution in a child’s first year of life can also have negative long-term impacts on
labor market outcomes, such as hours worked and earnings (Isen, RossinSlater, and Walker forthcoming).
Recent studies document large differences across counties in intergenerational economic mobility (Chetty et al. 2014) and find that these
differences directly affect children’s future outcomes (Chetty and Hendren
2015). About 60 percent of U.S. counties are positive contributors to intergenerational economic mobility, meaning that living in those counties during youth positively impacts the future income of children in low-income
households.9 Importantly, the duration of exposure to a better environment
also matters—suggesting that the future benefits are greater when a child
moves at an earlier age. For a child with parents at the 25th percentile of the
income distribution, each year a child spends in DuPage, Illinois (which has
the highest mobility of the 100 largest counties in the United States) raises
that child’s future earnings by 0.8 percent (Chetty and Hendren 2015).
In contrast, every year of childhood spent in Baltimore City, Maryland
(the worst of the 100 largest counties) reduces their future earnings by 0.7
percent.
Place also matters because segregation—both by race and by income—
has negative implications for those who grow up in these neighborhoods.
Living in a high-poverty neighborhood reduces access to jobs and career
networks (Spaulding et al. 2015). Racial segregation has also been shown to
have adverse effects on educational achievement and attainment, employment, earnings, single parenthood, and health (Cutler and Glaeser 1997;

Acevedo-Garcia and Lochner 2003).

The Role of Public Investment in Early Childhood
Early childhood investments can result in significant benefits for
children, parents, and society. However, children from disadvantaged
households often do not receive the investment they need to ensure their
healthy development and success in school because optimal investments are
resource-intensive and must happen early, while the benefits are realized
over a long time horizon. Indeed, the challenges inherent in investing in
children may be experienced by all parents; however, these obstacles can be
especially daunting for parents with limited resources.
First, the need to invest early presents a challenge. Because many of
the benefits—which include future earnings, health, and life satisfaction—
are delayed and accrue to children in adulthood, children rely on parents
and others to recognize these future returns on investment and to invest on
their behalf.
Second, the gains these investments produce require significant upfront costs. This can be difficult for families to afford on their own, particularly for low-income households, since they lack sufficient time and financial
resources or access to affordable credit to make these early investments.
Third, among factors that determine the quality of investment in
young children, neighborhood quality and other environmental factors can
be as important as family income. Many aspects of a child’s environment can
be difficult for parents to change on their own. Children from disadvantaged
households face additional risks as a result of their environment, and public
investments can improve these environmental inputs and supplement existing investments made by the family and community.
Finally, because many of the benefits accrue to society over a long time
period, individuals lack the incentive to invest at the level that would achieve
the highest social return. Indeed, the research surveyed later in this chapter
suggests that the societal benefits are potentially large and wide ranging, and
that these societal benefits often exceed the benefits received by the children
themselves. These benefits include: reductions in crime; lower expenditures
on health care, remedial education, and incarceration; and increased tax
revenue and lowered public assistance expenditure due to higher earnings.
In light of these challenges, well-designed public investments can play
a crucial role in closing income- and opportunity-related gaps that affect
short- and long-run outcomes of children (see Box 4-2 for a discussion of the
design of public investment). Public policy can also be key to ensuring that

172  |  Chapter 4

Box 4-2: Types of Public Investment
Policies to improve investment in early health and human capital
can take several forms. Income and in-kind transfers to families, direct
investments in the health and human capital of young children, and
investments that improve parental inputs can all help to compensate
for underinvestment in their learning and development that stems from
poverty. These various policies operate through different mechanisms
but all support children’s well-being in their formative years when it is
easier to close gaps and influence children’s lives.
1.  Direct investments in early childhood health and human capital
services: These investments provide direct access to early learning and
care to promote healthy child development and prepare children for
school. These programs include Head Start, child-care services, and
State-funded preschool, among others. Access to these services can
improve children’s short- and long-term health and human capital outcomes and can have huge positive spillover effects for society as a whole.
2.  Indirect investments through improved parental and home
inputs: Many of the programs reviewed later in this chapter, such as
the Nurse-Family Partnership Home Visiting Program and Head Start,
involve parental engagement. Some programs, such as the READY4K!
texting literacy intervention, are aimed entirely at improving children’s
home environments through parental behavior modifications. The
goal of these investments, whether standalone or embedded in other
initiatives, is to improve the quantity and quality of parental time with
children.
3.  In-kind transfers: Transfers in the form of health insurance
or food help families to meet basic medical and nutritional needs
while at the same time freeing up money for other types of consumption or investment. Examples include Medicaid, which helps parents
afford health care for themselves and their children, and nutrition
programs like the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,
Infants, and Children (WIC) and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program (SNAP), which provide food and nutritional guidance.
4.  Income transfers: Transfers in the form of cash provide flexible
support to low-income families and can help parents invest in their
children by alleviating resource and credit constraints. Examples include
Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), which provides a
temporary cash benefit to the poorest families, and two others only
available to those with earned income—the Earned Income Tax Credit
(EITC) and the low-income portion of the Child Tax Credit (CTC).
With regard to children’s outcomes, the impact of these programs (as
well as other programs that effectively increase disposable income) may

depend on how parents choose to invest the extra income. Further, these
programs may have additional impacts on children through the work
incentives (or disincentives) that they create for parents.

investments made now are large enough to pay off in the future and realize
the gains shown by research—including numerous public benefits.
Underinvestment in children’s health and human capital in their
earliest years can become more costly for society later in children’s lives.
Societal efforts that attempt to intervene later in life, for example through
remedial education or the juvenile justice system, tend to be less cost-effective than interventions that help children get, and stay, on the right track in
the first place. For example, the cost of incarceration is substantially higher
than investing in education or other programs to increase opportunity, even
before one takes the returns to the investments into account. The annual
cost of incarceration for a single juvenile is over $100,000— more than three
times the average tuition and fees at a four-year, non-profit private university, and more than 10 times as expensive as an average year of Head Start
(Figure 4-12).
Evidence suggests that investments in early childhood education may
reduce involvement with the criminal justice system. Lower crime translates
into benefits to society in the form of lowered costs of the criminal justice
system and incarceration, as well as reductions in the costs of crime to
victims (Heckman et al. 2010; Currie 2001; Reynolds et al. 2001). Likewise,
these improvements in children’s development may also reduce the need
for special education placements and remedial education.10 For example,
studies of preschool programs for low-income children have found benefitcost ratios of $7 to $12 for every $1 spent in the form of higher participant
earnings, lower remedial education costs, reduced transfer payments, and
reduced crime (Heckman et al. 2010).
Some early childhood investments, such as Early Head Start, Head
Start, and home visitation programs, which offer access to immunizations,
health services, and/or parenting education, have improved not only socialemotional and cognitive outcomes but also the health of program participants (Dodge et al. 2013; Kilburn 2014). These health improvements result
in lower societal expenditures on emergency care and health care.
Finally, public investments in young children, such as preschool, public health care, and income transfers, have been shown to improve children’s

long-term earnings potential (Brown, Kowalski, and Lurie 2015; Chetty,
Friedman, and Rockoff 2011; Barnett and Masse 2007). When the children
who receive these investments grow up, they pay more in taxes and are less
likely to receive public assistance. As a result, making these early investments would actually increase government revenue and reduce government
expenditure over time.

Policy Interventions That Improve
Children’s Outcomes
The evidence surveyed thus far overwhelmingly shows that, compared
with their higher-income peers, children born into lower-income households receive fewer investments in their early health and education. They
enter school at a substantial disadvantage on multiple measures of health,
cognition, and non-cognitive skills. Mounting theoretical and empirical
research also suggests that early investments in children can have especially
large economic returns. Yet despite these returns, parents with few resources
face several challenges to investing in their children.
Public policy has an important role to play in ensuring that highreturn investments in early childhood are realized, and in preventing and
closing opportunity gaps. Nevertheless, the relationships between early
childhood experiences and long-run outcomes are complex and mediated

Inequality in Early Childhood and Effective Public Policy Interventions   |  175

by many factors, which makes it difficult to isolate the impact of any given
policy. Research that demonstrates and measures the causal links between
interventions and outcomes is crucial for guiding effective policy.
This section reviews the most rigorous research on the impacts of
specific policy interventions that improve investments in early childhood
(see Box 4-3 for a list of major Federal early childhood policy interventions).
Attention is limited to studies that plausibly identify and measure the causal
impacts of these policies on outcomes rather than documenting correlations. The section first presents the evidence on policies that provide direct
investments in early childhood health and education, programs that aim to
improve parental inputs, and in-kind transfers such as health insurance and
food assistance programs. It then turns to the research on programs that
provide more flexible assistance to low-income families, such as income
transfers and housing assistance. A wide range of outcomes is considered—
including measures of short-run health and human capital (such as infant
and child mortality, birth weight, nutrition, test scores, and behavior and
emotional skills) as well as long-run outcomes such as adult health, employment, earnings, and involvement in the criminal justice system.
On the whole, the research evidence confirms that policy interventions ranging from preschool provision to income transfers have large and
sustained impacts on children’s health and human capital accumulation.
The evidence shows that these policies not only help children from disadvantaged families stay on pace with children from better-off families; they
also lead to large benefits for society as a whole.

Direct, Indirect and In-Kind Investments in Early Health and
Human Capital
The evidence discussed earlier in this chapter documented the existence of large gaps in health outcomes between children based on their
mother’s socioeconomic status. However, even as many measures of inequality have been rising in the United States, key measures of infant health, such
as low birth weight, show a steady decline in the socioeconomic gap in health
over the past 20 years (Figure 4-13). Recent research suggests that a range
of successful public policy interventions targeted at improving maternal and
infant health have played a key role in this trend. This section discusses some
of the most successful policies aimed at improving early health.

Policy Interventions in Early Health
Home Visitation
Several types of public investments target child development from
before children are born and throughout early childhood. Home visitation
programs, including those that are Federally funded by the Maternal, Infant,
and Early Childhood Home Visiting program, rely on trained professionals, including nurses, teachers, or social workers, to visit families during
pregnancy and shortly after a baby is born to provide a range of health,
development, and parenting information. Depending on the model, this
may include parental observations and instruction, nutrition and wellness
education, and psychological consultations. The goal of home visitation
programs is to ensure a healthy, safe, and supportive environment in the
first years of a child’s life. The programs tend to be targeted toward children
who are most at risk of receiving insufficient prenatal and antenatal health
care, including children of first-time, low-income, less-educated and/or
unemployed mothers.
These programs—which were expanded through new grants to States
under the Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA)—have shown promise in
reducing mortality among infants between 4 weeks and 1 year of age born to
mothers of low socioeconomic status. Poverty has been a major contributor

Box 4-3: Federal Early Childhood Programs: An Overview1
Various Federal programs help to close gaps in early investments in
health and education, as well as family resources, and improve later-life
outcomes. Millions of children benefit from this funding, often in the
form of grants to States, each year. In many cases, Federal policies and
investments complement, enhance, and expand State and local investments and policies.
Child Care and Development Fund: Assists low-income families
in obtaining child care so they can work or attend training/education.
The program, which is administered through block grants to States, also
improves the quality of child care and promotes coordination among
early childhood development and afterschool programs. In FY 2014, this
$5 billion fund served about 1.4 million children each month.
Head Start: Promotes school readiness of 3- and 4-year-old children from low-income families through education, health, social and
other services. Teachers facilitate individualized learning experiences
to promote children’s readiness for school and beyond. Children also
receive health and development screenings, nutritious meals, oral health
and mental health support. Additionally, parents and families are supported in achieving their own goals, such as housing stability, continued
education, and financial security. Together with Early Head Start, this $9
billion program served approximately 1 million children and pregnant
women in FY 2014 through grants to local entities.
Early Head Start: Provides early, continuous, intensive, and
comprehensive child development and family support services to lowincome infants and toddlers and their families, and pregnant women
and their families. This program also includes the Early Head Start-Child
Care Partnerships, which provide funding to States and local communities to increase the number of high-quality early learning opportunities
for infants and toddlers across the country.
Preschool Development Grants: Supports States in building or
enhancing a preschool program infrastructure that would enable the
delivery of high-quality preschool services to children, and expanding
high-quality preschool programs in targeted communities that would
serve as models for expanding preschool to all 4-year-olds from low- and
moderate-income families. This $250 million grant supported 18 States
in FY 2015 and is funded at $250 million for FY 2016.
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA): Serves infants
and toddlers through age 2 and children ages 3-5 with developmental
delays or high probabilities of developmental delays. These $791 million
1 Figures for funding and number of beneficiaries are for the most recent year for which
comprehensive data were available on February 1, 2016.

178  |  Chapter 4

Federally funded programs, administered by States, provided approximately 1.1 million children with special education and related services in
FY 2015.2 Many of the children are able to enter kindergarten no longer
needing special education services.
Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV):
Reaches pregnant women, expectant fathers, and parents and caregivers
of children under the age of 5. In these voluntary, evidence-based
programs, trained health care or social services professionals meet
regularly with expectant parents or families with young children to:
improve health and development; prevent child injuries, abuse, neglect,
or maltreatment; improve school readiness and achievement; improve
family economic self-sufficiency; and improve coordination with other
community resources. Through State and Tribal grants, this $400 million
program served approximately 115,500 parents and children in FY 2014.
Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP):
Provides health coverage to millions of Americans, including eligible
low-income adults, children, pregnant women, elderly adults and people
with disabilities. CHIP provides health coverage to eligible children
through both Medicaid and separate CHIP programs. These programs
receive both Federal and State dollars and are managed by States.
Together, Medicaid and CHIP provided health coverage to nearly 44
million children in FY 2014, including one-half of all low-income children in the United States.
Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants,
and Children  (WIC): Serves to safeguard the health of low-income
pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding women, infants, and children
up to age 5 who are at nutritional risk by providing nutritious foods to
supplement diets, information on healthy eating and breastfeeding, and
referrals to health care services. In FY 2015, nearly $7 billion was provided to States through Federal grants, and, in FY 2014, approximately
8 million people received WIC services, including roughly 4 million
children between 6 months and age 5, 2 million infants under 6 months,
and 2 million mothers.
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP): Provides
nutrition assistance to millions of eligible, low-income individuals and
families and provides economic benefits to communities. Formerly
known as Food Stamps, recipients receive State-administered monthly
benefits in the form of an Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card, which
can be used to purchase foods at authorized stores. This $76 billion

program served over 45 million Americans, including almost 7 million
children under the age of 5, in FY 2014.
Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC): Reduces the amount of taxes
qualified working people with low to moderate income owe and provides
refunds to many of these individuals. According to the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS), there were $68 billion in EITC claims from 28.8 million tax
filers for tax year 2013.
Child Tax Credit (CTC): Allows taxpayers to claim a credit of up to
$1000 per child under age 17, depending on the taxpayers’ income, and
is partially refundable, making it one of the largest tax-code provisions
benefitting families with children. According to the IRS, there were $55
billion in CTC claims for tax year 2013. The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy
Center (2013) estimates that roughly 40 million families claimed credits
in that year.
Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF): Provides temporary monthly cash assistance to needy families with dependent
children, while also preparing program participants for independence
through work. Replacing Aid to Families with Dependent Children
(AFDC), TANF now provides block grants to States and Tribes, which
States match with their own “maintenance of effort” funds to implement
the program. In 2015, this $17 billion program supported roughly 3
million children—though this number is approximately one-third of
the 1994 peak in AFDC (Falk 2015). As of FY 2013, over 40 percent of
children receiving TANF were age 5 and under.
Housing and Neighborhood Programs: Increases affordable housing options for low-income families through a variety of Federal
programs, including public housing, project-based rental assistance, and
the Housing Choice Voucher Program. The Section 8 Housing Choice
Vouchers Program—the largest Federal housing assistance program—
allows very low-income families to lease or (in a small number of cases,
purchase) safe, decent, and affordable privately owned rental housing,
including housing in higher opportunity neighborhoods. The Promise
Zone Initiative, announced in the 2013 State of the Union Address, is an
innovative partnership with local communities and businesses, one of
the major goals of which is to increase access to affordable housing and
improve public safety.

to the United States’ overall high infant mortality rate (Chen, Oster, and
Williams 2015). Home visitation programs have also been shown to improve
parenting behavior and children’s cognitive outcomes, especially among
families with low-birth-weight children (Sweet and Appelbaum 2004). By

improving parental behavior and children’s outcomes, these programs can
benefit children and parents in the long run.
One well-established program, the Nurse Family Partnership, provides first-time, low-income mothers with home visits during pregnancy
through their child’s second birthday. A longitudinal evaluation of the program found that participants who were randomly assigned to receive home
visitation services, compared with women who only received prenatal and
well-child clinic care, waited longer after the birth of their first child before
having a second child; had lower receipt of cash transfers; and exhibited
lower rates of arrest, drugs and alcohol abuse, and child abuse (Olds et al.
1997). The children of mothers who received home visitation services were
also less likely to be arrested, consumed less alcohol, had fewer behavioral
problems, had fewer sexual partners, smoked fewer cigarettes, and were less
likely to run away compared to children of mothers in the control group
(Olds et al. 1998). These studies measured outcomes at age 15, indicating
that the program impacts were sustained in the medium term.
A more recent analysis of the Nurse Family Partnership program
examined its impacts on children’s cognitive abilities and found improvement by age 6 among children whose mothers participated in the program.
These early cognitive gains were attributable to improvements in the home
environment and in parenting behavior, as well as to greater self-esteem and
lower anxiety among mothers, and they translated into improved language
and math abilities and fewer school absences at age 12 (Heckman et al. 2014).
Some home visitation programs are provided as part of the Federal
Head Start preschool program (described further below). A recent study
finds that Head Start programs that incorporated frequent home visitation
were particularly effective at improving non-cognitive outcomes compared
with other Head Start programs (Walters 2015). Other models of home
visitation programs are also showing promising results, with 19 models
meeting the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) criteria
for evidence-based home visiting programs (Administration for Children
and Families 2015). Ongoing data collection will allow for further rigorous
evaluation and help expand the knowledge base of the most effective home
visitation programs.
Based on the mounting evidence that home visiting programs have
significant positive impacts on children’s cognitive outcomes, Federal support for home visitation programs was introduced in 2008 and was further
expanded under the Affordable Care Act two years later. This ACA expansion was extended with bipartisan support through March 2015, and the
President proposed expanding and extending funding for another 10 years
in his 2013 State of the Union address. The Medicare Access and CHIP

Reauthorization Act of 2015, signed into law by the President in April 2015,
extends an annual $400 million in funding for the Maternal, Infant, and
Early Childhood Home Visiting programs through September 30, 2017.
Health Insurance
Research has established that access to insurance coverage during
childhood can have important benefits for educational and labor market
outcomes much later in life—benefits that appear to be mediated, at least in
part, through sustained improvements in health.
Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) provide low-cost health coverage to millions of Americans, including nearly 44
million children and covering one-half of all low-income children (Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services). The programs are funded jointly
by States and the Federal Government and are administered by States.
All children enrolled in Medicaid are entitled to the comprehensive set of
health care services known as Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and
Treatment (EPSDT). CHIP also ensures a comprehensive set of benefits
for children. Most States have elected to provide Medicaid to children with
family incomes above the minimum of 100 percent of the Federal Poverty
Level, and all States have expanded coverage to children with higher incomes
through CHIP.
A pair of recent studies have used the fact that States expanded access
to health insurance for children through Medicaid and CHIP at different times and to different extents in recent decades to study how access
to health insurance in childhood affects long-term educational and labor
market outcomes. Using data that connect individuals’ adult earnings and
tax information to their residence and family income in childhood (ages
0-18), Brown, Kowalski, and Lurie (2015) find that female children with
more years of Medicaid/CHIP eligibility in childhood (due to their State of
residence and year of birth) had higher educational attainment and higher
earnings in early adulthood. They also find evidence that both men and
women with greater access to childhood coverage pay more in income and
payroll taxes in their young adult years, potentially offsetting a substantial
fraction of the cost of providing Medicaid/CHIP coverage to children. The
authors estimate that a single additional year of Medicaid/CHIP eligibility
in childhood increased cumulative tax payments through age 28 by $186
(Figure 4-14; Brown, Kowalski, and Lurie 2015). The more years a child is
eligible, the larger the cumulative impact.
Related work by Cohodes et al. (2014) examines the impact of changes
in Medicaid/CHIP eligibility rules affecting children (ages 0-18) on educational attainment. The authors also find improvements in educational
attainment at age 22 to 29, with individuals who were eligible for Medicaid/

CHIP in childhood being more likely to complete high school and graduate
from college. These attainment impacts were similar regardless of the age at
which the child had Medicaid coverage.
New evidence from Miller and Wherry (2015) suggests that prenatal
Medicaid receipt can also have large long-term effects on health and economic outcomes. Like some of the other studies discussed above, Miller and
Wherry also examine variation in Medicaid and CHIP eligibility rules across
States and over time, but focus on eligibility for pregnant women rather than
children. Children whose mothers gained Medicaid coverage while pregnant
had lower rates of obesity and fewer hospitalizations related to endocrine,
nutritional, metabolic diseases, and immunity disorders between the ages of
19 and 32. The effects for children whose mothers gained Medicaid between
birth and age 18 (as opposed to in utero) were generally insignificant,
suggesting that receipt in utero is particularly important for these health
outcomes. Health gains for children whose mothers received Medicaid
while pregnant were also accompanied by improvements in educational and
economic outcomes, including higher high school graduation rates, higher
income, and lower SNAP receipt.
The literature on desegregation of health care facilities also demonstrates that access to health care during childhood can have large impacts
on children’s long-term outcomes. Almond, Chay, and Greenstone (2006)

Inequality in Early Childhood and Effective Public Policy Interventions   |  183

document that desegregation of hospitals during the 1960s resulted in
increased hospital access for African-American families, dramatic improvements in infant health for these families, and large declines in the racial gap
in infant mortality in the 1960s. Chay, Guryan, and Mazumder (2009) show
that these improvements in access to health care at birth and health soon
after birth led to large student achievement gains for African-American
teenagers in the 1980s, contributing to a reduction in the racial test score
gap. The researchers estimate that each additional early-life hospital admission made possible by desegregation raised test scores by between 0.7 and
1 standard deviation—an effect that implies a very large impact on lifetime
earnings.
Nutrition Programs
WIC

The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and
Children (WIC) is an assistance program that supports the health and nutrition of low-income pregnant and postpartum women, infants, and children
under the age of 5. More than 8 million people received WIC services in
FY 2014, including roughly 4 million children between 6 months and age
5, 2 million infants under 6 months, and 2 million mothers. WIC services
include health care referrals, nutrition education, and the provision of nutritious foods to supplement the diets of both mothers and their children.
There is a robust literature on the impact that this comprehensive set of
WIC services has on participants. Earlier studies comparing birth outcomes
of women who participate in WIC to those of other low-income women with
similar characteristics document that participants give birth to healthier
babies as measured along several dimensions (Bitler and Currie 2005; Joyce,
Gibson, and Colman 2005). More recent studies using rigorous methods
confirm that WIC participation leads to improved birth outcomes. One such
study focuses on the program’s initial roll out, which was implemented in
stages at the county level between 1972 and 1979. Hoynes, Page, and Stevens
(2011) compare birth information from the Vital Statistics Natality Data
among children who were born at similar times, but in different counties,
and therefore had different in utero exposure to WIC. These results suggest
that access to WIC increased birth weight among children born to mothers
who participated in WIC from the third trimester by around 10 percent, and
effects were largest among mothers with low levels of education.
Other work uses more recent data on local access to WIC. In some
States, like Texas, clients must apply for WIC in person, and distance to a
clinic can present a barrier to access. Rossin-Slater (2013) examines data
from the Texas Department of State Health Services on WIC clinic openings,

which include operating dates and ZIP codes for all clinics in the States,
and birth records that include information on birth outcomes and maternal characteristics. The author compares birth outcomes between siblings,
where one child was born when a clinic was open nearby, but one sibling
was born without a clinic, to separate the effect of WIC access from genes
and upbringing. This work shows that proximity to a WIC clinic increased
weight gain during pregnancy, birth weights, and the likelihood of breastfeeding upon hospital discharge.
Another recent paper by Currie and Rajani (2015) uses birth records
from New York City to look at birth outcomes, controlling for fixed and
time-varying characteristics of mothers that might affect selection into the
WIC program. The authors find that WIC reduced the probability that
the mother gained too little weight during pregnancy, improved receipt of
intensive medical services, and reduced the incidence of low birth weight,
even among full-term infants (Figure 4-15). Overall, the literature shows
that WIC has led to substantial gains in many of the most important indicators of early health, helping to close the gap in early health outcomes by
socioeconomic status.
SNAP

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, is the
cornerstone of the U.S. policy to address food insecurity—it is the largest
and most universal of a set of Federal food and nutrition programs designed
Inequality in Early Childhood and Effective Public Policy Interventions   |  185

to alleviate hunger by supplementing the food budgets of low-income
households. SNAP is broadly available to most low-income households,
with eligibility based primarily on income and assets. Over 45 million
Americans, including almost 7 million children under the age of 5, received
SNAP in FY 2014, as well as the elderly, working families, and individuals
with disabilities.
Eligible households generally must have a gross monthly income
below 130 percent of the official poverty guideline for their family size and
a net income that falls below the poverty line (USDA 2015). SNAP benefits
are distributed to eligible households on a monthly basis in the form of an
electronic benefit transfer (EBT) card, which can be used to purchase eligible
foods at authorized retail stores. The level of SNAP benefits is intended to fill
the gap between a household’s cash resources that are available to spend on
food and the amount needed to purchase a nutritious diet at minimal cost.
The latter amount is calculated using a model-based market basket of foods
known as the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP), which is adjusted for household size
but not for other factors such as local prices. The benefit formula assumes
that households can contribute 30 percent of their net income to purchase
food. A household’s SNAP allotment is thus equal to the TFP-based measure
of need, which gives the maximum allotment for that household’s size, less
30 percent of the household’s net income.
SNAP plays an important role in reducing poverty in the United States
and has been shown to be highly effective at reducing food insecurity. In
2014, SNAP benefits directly lifted at least 4.7 million Americans, including
2.1 million children, over the poverty line. Research has also shown that,
among households who receive SNAP, food insecurity rates are up to 30
percent lower than they otherwise would be, with impacts for children that
are at least this large (Council of Economic Advisers 2015c).
A growing body of high-quality research shows that SNAP and its
functionally similar predecessor, the Food Stamp Program, have led to
significant improvements in the health and wellbeing for those who receive
food assistance as young children. Almond, Hoynes, and Schanzenbach
(2011) study the impact of the early Food Stamp Program on birth outcomes
by studying the initial rollout of the program across US counties between
1961 and 1975. Using county level variation in the timing of implementation, they find that a mother’s access to Food Stamps during pregnancy led
to increased birth weight, with the greatest gains at the lower end of the
birth-weight distribution.
Related recent work uses similar cross-State variation and longitudinal data on children who received food stamps before birth and in the

adulthood (Hoynes, Schanzenbach, and Almond forthcoming). They find
that increased exposure to food stamps in utero and in early childhood led to
a significant reduction in the incidence of “metabolic syndrome,” including
a 16 percentage-point drop in the likelihood of being obese as adults for the
children of less-educated parents (Figure 4-16).11
Turning to the program’s impact on economic success and selfsufficiency, the authors find that early access to food stamps led to an 18 percentage-point increase in the likelihood of completing high school among
disadvantaged adults. Finally, their results show even broader impacts for
women, who benefitted through significant improvements in overall health
and economic self-sufficiency—including increased educational attainment,
increased earnings, and reduced participation in public assistance programs
(Figure 4-17).

Policy Interventions in Early Education
Investments in early childhood education can take a number of
forms and can benefit children through multiple channels. Policy interventions include preschool programs for children in the year before entering
kindergarten; child-care programs that provide a stimulating environment
for infants and toddlers; and programs that provide information and support services to parents and caregivers. Formal preschool and child-care
programs typically aim to improve early human capital—including both
cognitive and non-cognitive skills—through services provided directly
to children. Yet these programs may also benefit children indirectly; for
example, by helping parents to increase their labor force participation and
raising household income. Other interventions affect children’s outcomes
indirectly by providing services to the parent or caregiver that improve the
quality of their interactions with the children. Such caregiver interventions
may be standalone or may be coupled with formal child-care and preschool
programs (see Box 4-4 for examples of how technology can be used to
supplement formal early learning settings).
The United States has, over the past half-century, made tremendous
strides in expanding investment in formal early childhood education. Head
Start, established as part of the War on Poverty in 1964, and Early Head
Start, established in 1994, collectively provide comprehensive educational
and health services—including formal schooling, health and development
screenings, meals, and family support services—for approximately 1 million low-income children annually. States and localities are also making
11 The study measures metabolic syndrome as an index that puts equal weight on five related
components: high blood pressure, heart disease, heart attack, obesity, and diabetes. The results
show that among these components, Food Stamp exposure had the largest impact on obesity,
but all five components showed improvement.

Box 4-4: Technological Innovation that Stimulates
Learning during Out-of-School Time
Sesame Street & Early Childhood Education
Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have the potential to
enhance children’s experiences in early education, by extending low-cost
early education materials to large numbers of young children. One of the
earliest examples of such innovation is the educational program Sesame
Street.
A recent study on Sesame Street in its earliest years showed
that preschool-aged children who lived in areas where Sesame Street
was available were more likely to advance age-appropriately through
school. The results were particularly pronounced for boys, for children
in economically disadvantaged areas, and for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, including non-Hispanic African-American children.
Although the long-term outcome results were inconclusive, the authors
of the study suggest that the potential impacts of the program on advancing through school as appropriate, coupled with the very low cost for
each student ($5 a child annually), and the enhanced impact for students
from disadvantaged backgrounds, show promise for MOOCs to supplement early childhood education for low-income children (Kearney and
Levine 2015). It is important to note that the National Research Council
and the Institute of Medicine (2000) agree that children learn best
through enriching, social interactions with adults and peers in their lives,
including teachers and families. Sesame Street and other educational
programs are not intended to replace formal high-quality early education, or high-quality adult-child interactions in the earliest years; rather
they can serve as a supplement to the learning that happens in early
learning settings and with families at home by providing an opportunity
to spend out-of-school time learning.
This low-cost delivery of an effective curriculum continues to be
important for disadvantaged children today, since the costs of early
childhood care and educational activities have risen so rapidly in recent
years, putting high-quality education out of reach of many low-income
families. Low-cost supplements to early education, like Sesame Street,
can help low-income children gain some of the out-of-school educational experience received by higher-income children.
Texting to Improve Parental Inputs
Text messaging is another promising delivery method that can
improve parental behavior at low cost. Most American adults (88
percent) have cell phones and can receive texts (Zickuhr and Smith
2012), which have a 95-percent open rate (Mogreet 2013). READY4K!,
an eight-month-long text messaging program designed to help parents

of preschoolers support their child’s literacy development outside of the
classroom, significantly improved literacy during a pilot program in San
Francisco. The text messages sent to parents suggested simple, concrete
actions that could be taken at home to build on children’s classroom
learning, like suggesting specific ways to work on children’s literacy
skills during bath time. The intervention significantly increased positive
parental behaviors and school involvement, and improved children’s
literacy scores by up to 0.34 standard deviation. There is some evidence
that these impacts were larger for the children of African–American and
Hispanic parents (York and Loeb 2014). More READY4K! pilots are
underway across the country.

significant investments in early childhood education. Today, 40 States and
the District of Columbia have in place State-funded preschool programs,
serving more than one-quarter of all 4-year-olds in the 2012-13 school year.
To further increase opportunities for all children to begin kindergarten school-ready, the Obama Administration has proposed expanding highquality preschool for all low- and middle-income 4-year-olds, expanding
access to affordable high-quality child care for low- and moderate-income
families, and making effective home visitation programs for new parents
more widely available. Since President Obama put forth his Preschool for All
proposal in the 2013 State of the Union Address, the Federal Government
has invested $750 million in high-quality early childhood programs, through
the Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships for infants and toddlers, and
Preschool Development Grants. In addition, the Every Student Succeeds
Act, which President Obama signed into law in December 2015, includes
a new version of the Preschool Development Grant program, building on
the Administration’s commitment to expanding and establishing Statesupported high-quality preschool.
Child Care and Early Education Leading Up to Preschool
High-quality care for young children before they are eligible to attend
preschool can provide direct and indirect benefits for both children and parents. Specifically, high-quality child care may benefit children by ensuring
that they are in safe, stimulating, and nurturing learning environments while
away from parents (Havnes and Mogstad 2011). By increasing the probability that parents are working, child-care access may also benefit children
by supplementing family resources, thereby reducing financial hardship and
possibly related stressors.
Parents are best able to work when they have access to stable, highquality, affordable child-care arrangements, allowing them to better support
190  |  Chapter 4

their children through wages. Studies generally find that improving the
affordability of child care increases employment for parents, particularly
mothers. For instance, a universal subsidy that lowered the cost of child care
to $5 a day in Quebec increased maternal labor force participation by about 8
percentage points (Baker et al. 2008; Lefebvre and Merrigan 2008). Similarly,
an evaluation of a near-universal U.S. child-care program during the 1940s
found that it substantially increased maternal employment (Herbst 2014).
More recently, research showed that U.S. child-care subsidies that reduced
the cost of child care by 10 percent increased employment among single
women by 0.5 percent (Herbst 2010).
Evidence on the lifetime benefits of programs targeted to very young
children comes from studies that have tracked participants in such programs
into adulthood. One well-known program, the Abecedarian Project, provided poor children born in North Carolina between 1972 and 1977 with a
full-time, high-quality educational intervention from infancy through age
5. The project, which was funded through both Federal and State grants,
used a randomized design to allocate spots in the program and collected
detailed longitudinal data on child and family outcomes. Although the
program served a relatively small number of children (57), it is a landmark
study for its rigorous design and for establishing credible, causal evidence
that educational interventions at a very early age can affect participants over
their lifetimes.
Children’s gains from the Abecedarian Project persisted through
adolescence and adulthood. Beginning at 18 months, program participants
had higher scores on tests of various cognitive skills and scored higher on
math and reading achievement tests, and these achievement gains persisted
through ages 15 and 21 (Ramey and Campbell 1984; Campbell and Ramey
1995; Campbell et al. 2001). In addition, participants had higher high school
graduation and college attendance rates, as well as more years of schooling.
These achievement gains translated to large earnings gains as participants
entered the labor force. At age 30, participants had income gains of over 60
percent relative to the control group (Campbell et al. 2012). The benefits
of Abecedarian also accrued to parents, as the program increased maternal
earnings by about $90,000 over the mother’s career, approximately double
the estimated earnings gains for participant children based on their higher
levels of educational attainment (about $50,000) (Barnett and Masse 2007).12
Between 1985 and 1988, the Infant Health and Development Program
(IHDP) expanded the Abecedarian model to eight U.S. cities, targeting a sample of low-birth-weight, premature infants. IHDP significantly
improved cognitive outcomes among a diverse group of students during the

program and up to 15 years after completing the program (Brooks-Gunn et
al. 1994; Gross et al. 1997; McCarton et al. 1997; McCormick et al. 2006).
Low-income children benefited the most from the program, and projections
suggest that either a universal or income-based program similar to IHDP
would essentially eliminate income-based gaps in IQ at age 3 and would
substantially reduce IQ gaps at ages 5 and 8 (Duncan and Sojourner 2014).
In 1994, the Head Start program, which was established in 1964 for
preschool-aged children (mainly 3 or 4 years of age), expanded access to
younger children through Early Head Start. Early Head Start provides services for at-risk pregnant women, new mothers, children ages zero to 3, and
their families and focuses on positive parenting and home environments
and children’s developmental outcomes. Over 100,000 children ages 2 and
younger were enrolled in Early Head Start in FY 2012 (Office of Head Start
2015).
The impacts of Early Head Start have been studied through the Early
Head Start Research and Evaluation Project, which randomly assigned
children to receive Early Head Start services and tracked children’s performance through elementary school. Children who participated in Early
Head Start showed less aggressive behavior, greater vocabulary and language
development, and higher cognitive skills upon the program’s completion.
These gains were especially pronounced among African-American children.
Parents who received Early Head Start services showed greater engagement
during play and greater support for language and learning development at
home (Love et al. 2005). Other studies of Early Head Start have found similar results for cognitive development and language acquisition (Vogel et al.
2013; Vallotton et al. 2012), as well as for home environments (Green et al.
2014; Love et al. 2002).
While most research on child care has focused on specific, targeted
interventions like Abecedarian and Early Head Start, some studies have
shown that government provision of child-care subsidies can also improve
children’s outcomes. Two studies from Norway demonstrate that child-care
subsidies can improve children’s academic performance (Black et al. 2012)
and, later in life, increase educational attainment, decrease receipt of cash
transfers, and increase labor-market participation (Havnes and Mogstad
2011). In the United States, evidence on the impact of child-care subsidies
comes from a study of the Lanham Act of 1940, which funded the provision
inexpensive and universal public child care through wartime stimulus grants
between 1943 and 1946. A recent study examining outcomes of adults who
were children during these years finds that growing up in a State that spent
heavily on child care under the Lanham Act led to increased educational
attainment and earnings capacity, making children more likely to graduate
192  |  Chapter 4

from high school, earn a college degree, and work full-time. For each $100
increase in spending on the program, participants’ average annual earnings
in adulthood rose by 1.8 percent. These benefits proved largest for the poorest children served (Herbst 2014).
To be sure, the quality of child care is important for children’s outcomes, and higher-quality child care is associated with better social skills,
cooperation, and language development. Important aspects of high-quality
care may include the use of evidence-based curricula, longer program
duration, high teacher effectiveness, and parental involvement, and productive and complementary use of out-of-school time (Council of Economic
Advisers 2015a). Low-quality care may explain why some studies have found
that universal $5 a day child care in Quebec adversely affected children’s
behaviors, and why some studies of U.S. child-care subsidies also find negative effects on child achievement and behavioral outcomes (Baker et al. 2008;
Baker et al. 2015; Bernal and Keane 2011; Herbst and Tekin 2010, 2014).
These disparate results underscore the importance of efforts to enhance not
only the quantity, but also the quality of child-care programs.
Preschool
A large body of literature demonstrates that preschool can benefit
children’s school readiness and increase earnings and educational attainment later in life by improving both cognitive and non-cognitive skills.
Preschool is one of the most studied early childhood human capital interventions, with an unusually deep research base beginning with randomized
evaluations of well-known, but small, Federally supported programs like
Abecedarian (described above) and Perry Preschool (described below) that
began in the 1960s and whose participants’ outcomes have been tracked
well into adulthood. Much of what we know about the effects of larger-scale
preschool programs comes from Head Start, the most widely available public
preschool program for lower-income children. However, there is growing
evidence from a number of new preschool programs, including State preschool programs in Georgia and Oklahoma and local initiatives in Chicago
and Boston. Researchers have also collected results from numerous studies
of smaller programs and used meta-analysis to discern general tendencies in
impacts, thereby drawing more general conclusions from a large number of
analyses.
The High/Scope Perry Preschool Program, which operated in Ypsilanti,
Michigan during the 1960s, provided preschool education for low-income
African-American children who were at high risk of failing in school. Perry
is one of the most well-known preschool interventions in part because it
was evaluated using a randomized trial yielding highly credible results and
also because data on its participants were collected more routinely and over
Inequality in Early Childhood and Effective Public Policy Interventions   |  193

a longer period than is true of most other program evaluations of any kind
(Schweinhart et al. 2005). Participants in Perry Preschool were randomly
assigned to either a treatment group, who attended preschool at ages 3 and 4,
or to a control group that received no preschool program. Researchers have
examined how these two groups fared on a wide range of outcomes through
the ages of 39 to 41.
Perry increased IQ scores at school entry, and other gains persisted
through school and into adulthood (Schweinhart et al. 2005). Participants
demonstrated higher motivation, placed a higher value on schooling, did
more homework, and demonstrated higher achievement through age 15
(Schweinhart and Weikart 1981). The program group scored better on several cognitive and academic tests through age 27 (Barnett 1996; Schweinhart
2003). In addition to performing better on cognitive tests, educational
attainment and labor market outcomes also improved among program
participants. High-school graduation rates rose by about 19 percentage
points, and when participants entered the workforce, they had earnings
about 25 percent higher than their control group counterparts through age
40 (Heckman et al. 2010). Other observations of Perry participants later in
life found similarly large increases in earnings ranging from 19 percent to
nearly 60 percent (Bartik 2014; Karoly et al. 1998).13
While evidence from narrowly targeted programs like Perry provide
valuable evidence that early interventions can have large and sustained
benefits, an important policy question is whether larger-scale programs
can provide similar benefits. One larger-scale early childhood education
intervention for which research has found positive impacts in both the
short term and long term is the Chicago Child-Parent Centers (CPC). Since
1967, the CPC have provided comprehensive early childhood education
and family supports to low-income children and parents. At kindergarten
entry, studies show that CPC preschoolers’ cognitive readiness improved by
about three months of learning and math and reading achievement gains
persisted through sixth grade (Reynolds 1995). Later evaluations found
that participation in the CPC preschool program led to higher high-school
graduation and college attendance rates (Temple and Reynolds 2007), and
that participants, in turn, saw increases in annual earnings in their late 20s
of about 7 percent (Reynolds et al. 2011).14
Additional evidence on the effectiveness of large-scale and long-running preschool programs comes from modern evaluations of the Head Start

program. The Head Start Impact Study (HSIS) followed a nationally representative sample of nearly 5,000 children who were 3 or 4 years old in 2002
(Puma et al. 2012). One-half of these children were randomly assigned to a
group that was allowed to enroll in a Head Start program, and the rest were
assigned to a control group who did not receive access to Head Start but
could enroll in another early childhood program. The study, which examined children’s cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes through third grade,
found positive impacts on children’s language and literacy development
during the first year of the program—especially for students whose scores
were initially at the bottom of the distribution. These gains were generally
attenuated over time, as measured by tests in elementary school, though the
gains persisted through at least first grade for some Spanish speakers (Bitler,
Hoynes, and Domina 2014).
Studies of Head Start have generally found positive, but somewhat
smaller, impacts on test scores than the impacts found by studies of earlier
programs like Perry. However, several factors are important for understanding these differences. One is that the early, narrowly targeted programs like
Perry and Abecedarian were more intensive and more costly than Head
Start and might therefore be expected to yield a higher return. A second
issue, highlighted by a growing number of researchers, is that early education programs may have long-run benefits even when the program effect
on test scores appears to “fade out” in elementary or middle school—and
a study by Deming (2009) suggests that this is true for Head Start.15 This
study compares long-run outcomes of siblings who differed in their program
participation and finds that, despite a fadeout of test score gains, children
who participated in Head Start are more likely to graduate from high school.
Looking at a summary index of young-adult outcomes, the study finds that
Head Start participation closes one-third of the gap between children with
median family income and those in bottom quarter of family income and
is about 80 percent as large as model programs such as Perry. The finding
of long-run benefits despite elementary school test score fadeout may also
apply to other public preschool programs, such as Tennessee’s Voluntary
Pre-K program, where researchers found evidence of test-score fadeout, but
where long-term outcomes cannot yet be measured (Lipsey, Farran, and
Hofer 2015).
Yet another reason why modern program evaluations such as HSIS
are likely to produce smaller measured effects than earlier studies of programs like Perry is simply that the outcomes of children in the “control
group” of these studies, which provide a baseline for comparison, are likely
15 Other studies, such as Heckman et al. (2010), also find evidence of long-term benefits despite
short-term fadeout.

to be higher today than in the past. As highlighted in a new study by Kline
and Walters (2015), children in earlier control groups typically received no
formal education if they were not assigned to the program being studied,
while children today—including those in the HSIS—are much more likely
to attend an alternative preschool program. Kline and Walters (2015) also
show that benefits of Head Start are larger for children who would not otherwise attend preschool, suggesting that further expansion of program access
would yield significant gains.
In addition to the large positive impacts on cognitive skills and labor
market outcomes, recent research also shows that the benefits of high-quality preschool programs like Perry, Abecedarian, and Head Start can extend
to improvements in health and non-cognitive outcomes. Ludwig and Miller
(2007), examining the effects of technical assistance provided to some counties to develop Head Start funding proposals that led to increased Head Start
funding in the late 1960s and 1970s, find that access to Head Start at the age
of 3 or 4 had significant implications for child mortality between the ages
of 5 and 9. Their results indicate that, for children living in the 300 poorest
U.S. counties, a 50 to 100 percent increase in Head Start funding reduced
mortality rates from relevant causes enough to essentially close the gap
between these counties and the national average. A new study examining
the Perry Preschool and Abecedarian programs shows that these programs
affected health and risky behavior over the long run, in part by reducing the
likelihood of smoking as an adult for some participants (Conti, Heckman,
and Pinto 2015). Similarly, Campbell et al. (2014) find that participation in
the Abecedarian Project led to better adult health outcomes such as lower
blood pressure.
Interestingly, the impacts of some early education initiatives appear
to differ by gender, though the gender differences are not always consistent
across studies and their underlying causes are not always well understood.
Anderson (2008) finds larger impacts of three preschool programs on longterm outcomes for girls, possibly because girls respond differently to schooling interventions. Compared to boys, girls participating in the programs saw
sharper increases in high-school graduation and college attendance rates,
along with positive effects for economic outcomes, criminal behavior, drug
use, and marriage. These results are consistent with Oden et al. (2000), who
find that Head Start participation in Florida significantly raises high-school
graduation rates and lowers arrest rates for girls but not boys. On the other
hand, Conti, Heckman, and Pinto (2015) find that the long-run health benefits of Perry and Abecedarian are larger for boys.
In addition to the studies highlighted above, numerous other studies
have rigorously evaluated the impact of preschool programs since the 1960s.
196  |  Chapter 4

A meta-analysis by Duncan and Magnuson (2013) examines the distribution
of impacts for more than 80 programs, including Head Start, Abecedarian,
and Perry as well as dozens of other preschool programs. Overall, across all
studies and time periods, early childhood education increases cognitive and
achievement scores by 0.35 standard deviations on average, or more than
one-quarter of the kindergarten math test score gap between the highest
and lowest income quintiles (Duncan and Magnuson 2011). The estimated
impacts in the studies considered in Duncan and Magnuson (2013) are illustrated in Figure 4-18, with bigger circles generally corresponding to studies
that enrolled more children. Figure 4-18 shows that the vast majority of
programs benefit children’s cognitive development and achievement at the
end of the program.
The downward slope of the line in Figure 4-18 suggests that the effect
sizes of early childhood education programs have fallen somewhat over
time. However, as discussed above, a new study by Kline and Walters (2015)
suggests that this pattern does not reflect declining program quality, but may
be driven in part by an improving counterfactual for students not enrolled
in the program being studied.
One likely source of the improving academic outcomes for children
who are not enrolled in Head Start or other more narrowly targeted programs is the recent expansion of large, State-run public preschool programs.
Wong et al. (2008) examine five State-run preschool programs and find
positive impacts on achievement test scores. Gormley et al. (2005) evaluate
Oklahoma’s preschool program in Tulsa and find that children’s kindergarten achievement significantly improved. While it is too soon to directly estimate these programs’ long-term effects since the oldest participants have not
yet entered the labor force, Hill, Gormley and Adelstein (2015) find evidence
of a persistent improvement in the Tulsa program’s impacts through third
grade for some students. Recent evaluations find positive cognitive outcomes at fourth grade of Georgia’s State-run preschool program (Fitzpatrick
2008) and some persistent, though smaller, effects of Georgia and Tulsa’s
programs through eighth grade (Cascio and Schanzenbach 2013). These
studies also show that, even when some participating children switch from
private programs (a phenomenon often referred to as “crowd-out”), there
can still be gains in achievement for these children who would have otherwise been in private programs, perhaps because families can use the savings
from switching to a public program to make other positive investments in
their children. A new working paper has also found evidence of the nonacademic impacts of universal preschool on criminal activity. Oklahoma’s
universal preschool program lowered the likelihood that African-American

participants were charged with a misdemeanor or felony in their late teen
years (Smith 2015).
Students who attended State-run preschool, such as those in Georgia
and Oklahoma, are not yet old enough to directly measure earnings; however, researchers have used achievement gains to estimate that adult earnings for these children will likely increase by 1.3 to 3.5 percent (Cascio and
Schanzenbach 2013).16 Other studies also project large positive effects on
lifetime earnings (Bartik, Gormley, and Adelstein 2012; Duncan, Ludwig,
and Magnuson 2010).
Although studies find that early childhood education yields a large
return, the payoff may take time to materialize as benefits are realized
through behavior or earnings changes over an individual’s lifecycle. When a
child attends an early education program, an upfront cost is incurred. Some
benefits are realized immediately—for example, parents who choose to reenter the labor force or increase their work hours are able to increase their
earnings right away. However, the majority of benefits, from reduced crime
to higher earnings for participants, accrue later in life. In the case of Perry
Preschool, evidence on long-run outcomes, including increases in earnings and savings from education and social program utilization, suggests
16 Studies generally use increases in test scores to predict the future increase in earnings using
estimates from Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff (2014) or Krueger (2003).

that benefits continue to rise throughout participants’ lives (Figure 4-19;
Heckman et al. 2010).
Although it took time for the benefits of Perry Preschool to appear,
Heckman et al. (2010) estimate that the benefits quickly outweighed the
initial cost and that the net benefit increased over the course of participants’
lifetimes. The timing of benefits for modern universal programs will likely
follow a similar lifecycle pattern. When the savings from crime reduction are
also included, the estimated total discounted benefits of Perry are almost 80
percent higher.17
Estimates based on the substantial earnings gains alone indicate that
investing in early childhood education would boost GDP in the long run.
If all families enrolled their children in preschool at the same rate as highincome families, enrollment would increase by about 13 percentage points.18
If the earnings gains per student were similar to the estimated gains from
17 CEA calculation based on Heckman et al. (2010) discounted lifetime benefits from earnings,
crime reduction, K-12 and other education up to age 27, and social program use, with a
discount rate of 3 percent.
18 In 2013, about 71.7 percent of four-year-olds from families with income of $100,000 or
more were in preschool, but only 59.0 percent of the overall population was enrolled (Current
Population Survey, October Supplement; CEA calculations). Thus about 12.7 percent of each
cohort would be affected.

the preschool programs in Georgia and Oklahoma, the total gains resulting
from the increase in enrollment would raise the level of GDP by 0.17 to 0.44
percent a year after 60 years, when higher levels of enrollment would be fully
reflected in the labor force. This is equivalent to adding between approximately $30 and $80 billion a year based on 2015 GDP.19 This estimate does
not include the gains to GDP that would result from earnings gains for
parents and the many non-earnings benefits of quality preschool education,
including expanded economic activity due to reduced crime and possible
spillovers to other workers who did not directly benefit from the program
as children.

Income and Other Near-Cash Transfer Programs
In addition to providing direct investments or in-kind transfers to
disadvantaged children and their families, public policy can also provide
more flexible support to low-income families in the form of income transfers. Programs like the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child Tax Credit, and
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families are targeted mainly at families
with children, and can benefit children by helping their families to invest
more resources in their early development. Similarly, housing programs
also provide flexible and multi-faceted support to low-income families and
can produce especially large benefits for poor families with young children.
Programs like the Housing Choice Voucher program not only free up a family’s income so that more of it can be invested in their children, but can also
improve children’s living conditions in ways that can be highly beneficial to
their development.
A large body of literature shows that a boost to income can vastly
improve young children’s health and human capital attainment. An influx
of income in children’s earliest years may provide a particularly large boost
to short-term and long-term health and human capital outcomes (Duncan,
Magnuson, and Vortuba-Drzal 2014). For programs that are not targeted
solely at young children, the academic literature does not always distinguish
between impacts in the first few years of life from impacts throughout childhood as a whole; where the evidence exists, this chapter presents evidence
showing the impacts of income in children’s earliest years (see Box 4-5 for
discussion of sustaining these impacts in later childhood years).
19 Cascio and Schanzenbach (2013) estimate that these programs increase earnings by 1.3
to 3.5 percent per year. After 60 years, the labor force would fully reflect the higher levels of
enrollment; hence 12.7 percent of each cohort’s earnings would increase by 1.3 to 3.5 percent
per year, yielding an increase in aggregate earnings of 0.17 percent to 0.44 percent. Using 2015
GDP as of February 1, 2016 ($17.94 trillion), this yields an increase of $29.6 to $79.7 billion per
year.

Box 4-5: Nutrition and Income Programs Help Sustain
Human Capital Development throughout Childhood
While policies that address inequities in nutrition and family
resources are critical for preventing and closing gaps in human capital
before children enter school, these policies also help to sustain the gains
from early childhood investments and to close gaps in children’s cognitive and non-cognitive development once they enter school.
Two recent studies demonstrate a link between Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits and children’s performance in school by showing how student outcomes vary with the timing
of benefit receipt. SNAP benefits are distributed on a monthly basis and
many low-income families see their food intake reduced over the course
of each month as their budgets are depleted (Shapiro 2005; Hastings
and Washington 2010; Todd 2014). Gassman-Pines and Bellows (2015)
analyze test scores of students in grades 3 through 8 in North Carolina
and find that for children in households receiving SNAP—but not for
students from higher-income households—test scores fall at the end of
the month when food budgets tend to be depleted. They find also that
scores recover gradually after the next month’s benefits are received—
suggesting that a steady diet is a prerequisite for optimal learning and
test performance. A related study of fifth through eighth graders in the
City of Chicago School District suggests that disruptions in food budgets
also lead to disciplinary problems in school. Gennetian et al. (2015) find
that disciplinary incidents rise toward the end of the month, especially
for students in SNAP households. This pair of findings suggests that food
assistance programs like SNAP are important complements to educational investments. They also suggest that, for many families, additional
support to help sustain food budgets throughout the month would lead
to further improvements in children’s academic performance and would
help close achievement gaps.
Other studies have shown that children’s performance in school
responds to increases in their family’s income due to policies such as
the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or the Child Tax Credit (CTC).
Under both the EITC and the CTC, the transfer a family is eligible to
receive depends on household income; both policies offer a flat subsidy
in a certain range that is phased out at higher incomes, and the EITC also
has a phase-in range at very low incomes. Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff
(2011) use these changes in the tax rates to identify the extent to which
benefit receipt improves academic performance. Linking data from a
large school district on children’s test scores, teachers, and schools from
grades 3 through 8 with administrative tax records on parental earnings,
they find that a credit of $1,000 increases elementary- and middle-school

Inequality in Early Childhood and Effective Public Policy Interventions   |  201

test scores by 6 to 9 percent of a standard deviation. Similar effects are
found in related work by Dahl and Lochner (2012), who examine the
impact of EITC expansions in the late-1980s and mid-1990s on math
and reading test scores using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.
Their study finds that an additional $1,000 in family income raises children’s test scores by about 6 percent of a standard deviation, with larger
effects for children under 12 years of age.

Income Transfers: EITC, CTC, and AFDC/TANF
The Earned Income Tax Credit provides a refundable tax credit to
lower-income working families. As of 2012, 97 percent of EITC dollars went
to families with children (Falk and Crandall-Hollick 2014) and an earlier
estimate suggests that approximately one-quarter of children receiving EITC
benefits are under the age of 5 (Gothro and Trippe 2010). A family’s credit
amount is based on the number of dependent children and its earnings. A
large and robust literature shows that the EITC increases labor force participation among single mothers (Eissa and Hoynes 2011; Eissa and Liebman
1996; Meyer and Rosenbaum 2001). The low-income portion of the Child
Tax Credit, which is partially refundable, has a similar structure to the EITC
and could therefore be expected to have proportionally similar positive
impacts on low-income families. Together, the EITC and the refundable
portion of the CTC directly lifted 5.2 million children over the poverty
line in 2014 (Short 2015), and the additional work incentives and associated earnings may have amplified this effect. Empirical work on the EITC’s
impacts tends to compare families that became eligible for a larger credit
with families with similar observable characteristics that were ineligible for
a change in their credit.
The EITC has been expanded in every Administration since 1975
(Council of Economic Advisers 2014). Most recently, under the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the EITC was expanded for
families with three or more children, the marriage penalty was reduced,
and the refundable portion of the Child Tax Credit was expanded, all on
a temporary basis. These changes were made permanent by Congress last
December. Examining the 1986, 1990, and 1993 reforms, which expanded
the amount for which some families were eligible, particularly families with
multiple children, Hoynes, Miller, and Simon (2015) use Vital Statistics data
covering all births from 1984 to 1998. These data provide information on
birth weight and birth order, as well as some maternal demographic information. Since families with a first, second, or third and higher-order birth
experience a different EITC schedule, the authors compare birth outcomes
202  |  Chapter 4

for single mothers across these groups and find that an additional $1,000
in EITC receipt lowers the prevalence of low birth weight by 2 to 3 percent
(Hoynes, Miller, and Simon 2015). Using information on doctor visits during pregnancy and from birth certificate records on smoking and drinking
during pregnancy, they speculate that one channel for health improvements
is through better prenatal care and health.
Researchers also find impacts of Federal and State EITC receipt as
a young child on educational attainment later in their school years. In
these studies, the impacts are concentrated among students who received
the EITC as young children, suggesting a particularly important role for
income in early years. Michelmore (2013) finds that a $1,000 increase in the
maximum EITC for which a child is eligible based on the State they live in is
associated with a one percentage-point increase in the likelihood of college
enrollment and a 0.3 percentage-point increase in the likelihood of receiving
a bachelor’s degree among 18-23 year olds. The attainment benefits of EITC
receipt were almost entirely driven by children who were 12 or younger
when their State implemented the EITC, with a 3 percentage-point impact
on college enrollment. Using a similar method, Maxfield (2013) finds that an
increase in the maximum EITC of $1,000 increases the probability of high
school completion at age 19 by 2 percentage points and the probability of
completing at least one year of college by age 19 by 1.4 percentage points.
Like in the Michelmore (2013) paper, Maxfield (2013) finds that the magnitudes of these impacts decrease as the age at which children became eligible
for the EITC increases. A $1,000 increase in the maximum EITC available
to a preschooler increases high school completion by 3.6 percentage points,
versus a 1.9 percentage-point increase for a middle schooler. Altogether, the
studies show that EITC receipt as a young child can have profound impacts
on educational and labor market outcomes later in life.
In a study of a similar kind of income transfer, but without a work
requirement, Aizer et al. (forthcoming) examine the Mothers’ Pension, a cash
assistance program in effect from 1911 to 1935, and a precursor to AFDC
and TANF. The authors use data from World War II enlistment records, the
Social Security Death Master File through 2012, and 1940 Census records on
16,000 men to compare mortality of children of any age (0-18) who benefited from the program to similar children of the same age living in the same
county whose mothers applied, but were denied benefits. They find that the
program reduced mortality through age 87 among recipient children (Figure
4-20) and that the lowest-income children experienced the largest benefits.
Census and enlistment records suggest that these improvements may be
at least partly due to the improvements in nutritional status (measured by
underweight status in adulthood), educational attainment, and income in

early- to mid-adulthood. Documenting that the most common reason for
rejection was “insufficient need,” the authors argue their results provide a
lower-bound estimate of the program’s effects.
The positive impacts associated with the EITC may operate through
multiple channels. Most obvious is the increase in income that families
experience. A less obvious channel for the positive impacts could be through
increases in maternal labor supply that resulted from EITC expansions or
via other policy changes that occurred at the same time as those expansions
(Nichols and Rothstein 2015). It may be that at least some of the effects captured in the studies operate through the less obvious channels. Studies that
use variation based on EITC expansions over time may be especially likely
to capture some effects associated with other policy changes. For example,
the 1991 EITC expansions coincide with an increase in the minimum wage,
and the 1996 expansions coincide with welfare reform.
Some studies suggest that EITC impacts may differ somewhat by gender, since a lower baseline level of health and human capital among young
boys may make income targeted toward these investments in them particularly impactful. For example, a study of Canadian child benefits finds that
increases in benefits lead to larger improvements in education and physical
health variables for boys (Milligan and Stabile 2011).

Experiment

Housing and Neighborhoods
Moving to a lower-poverty neighborhood as a child can have a profound impact on multiple health and human capital outcomes, both in the
short term and long term. These impacts are driven in part by changes in
the availability of health and human capital inputs reviewed earlier in this
chapter, and in part due to related changes in peer effects, crime, safety, and
other environmental factors.
Compelling evidence that the opportunity to move to a better neighborhood can dramatically impact children’s lives comes from a randomized controlled trial conducted in the mid-1990s known as the Moving to
Opportunity program (MTO). MTO allowed researchers to evaluate the
impact of both conventional Section 8 housing vouchers, which do not place
any geographic restrictions on where recipients can live, and experimental
vouchers that required families to move to lower-poverty neighborhoods for
at least one year.
A new study by Chetty, Hendren, and Katz (forthcoming), which
is the first to look at adult outcomes for children whose parents received
housing vouchers, finds remarkably large benefits—especially when voucher
receipt was contingent on moving to a low-poverty neighborhood. Among
children who were younger than 13 when their families moved, Section 8
vouchers increased adult earnings by 15 percent and experimental vouchers

Inequality in Early Childhood and Effective Public Policy Interventions   |  205

increased earnings by 31 percent (Figure 4-21). Moreover, the earnings gains
were largest when children’s parents moved in their earlier years and fell
with the age when children moved—suggesting that the cumulative impact
of exposure to a better environment is highest when children move in early
childhood.
The authors also find that children whose families received vouchers
when they were young were ultimately 32 percent more likely to attend college and, among those who attended college, the voucher recipients went to
higher-quality schools. While the program did not have a significant effect
on birth rates, girls whose families received vouchers were more likely to be
married between the ages of 24 and 30 and those whose families received
experimental vouchers were more likely to have the father present when
they did have children. Importantly, these positive outcomes were limited
to individuals who moved at younger ages and did not accrue to those who
moved past the age of 13—again suggesting that neighborhood quality is
especially influential in a child’s most formative years.

CONCLUSION
When we invest in young children, it is not just children and their
families who benefit. The research highlighted here suggests that the investments we make in children today could benefit our economy in the long
run by expanding our skilled workforce and increasing their earnings, as
well as by improving health and wellness. This means society reaps the
benefits of a better-educated, higher-earning, and healthier population in
the future—including lower transfer payments, reduced involvement with
the criminal justice system, lower health care costs, and a larger tax revenue
base. Expanding access to high-quality programs that support children in
their earliest years is a win-win opportunity for participating children, their
parents, and society as a whole. It is time to build on demonstrated successes
of programs that invest in young children and broaden their scope to boost
opportunity for more American children.

roductivity growth is critical to the well-being of the American
economy, its workers, and its households. Growth in labor productivity
means American workers generate more output for a given amount of work,
which can lead to higher living standards via higher wages, lower prices,
and a greater variety of products.1 Labor productivity growth in the United
States has come down from its highs in the middle of the 20th century (see
Figure 5-1), though less dramatically than in other advanced economies that
had experienced a surge in productivity in the immediate aftermath of the
second World War. Between 1990 and 2000, U.S. labor productivity growth
rebounded. However, over the last decade, even though the United States
has led other advanced countries in labor productivity growth, achieving
robust measured productivity growth has been a substantial challenge.2
Labor productivity growth—measured as output per hour—comes
from three primary sources: increases in capital, improvements in the quality of labor, and “total factor productivity” (TFP, or what the U.S. Bureau
of Labor Statistics formally refers to as multifactor productivity). The first
source—the accumulation of physical capital—fuels productivity growth
through investments in machines, tools, computers, factories, infrastructure, and other items that are used to produce new output. The second
source, labor quality upgrades, comes from greater education and training
of the workers who operate these machines, tools and computers, as well as
manage factories and infrastructure, to produce output. Rapid increases in
capital accumulation or educational attainment can increase the output per
hour of an economy and potentially improve living standards. There are,
however, generally limits to the extent of productivity gains that can result
1 The 2010 Economic Report of the President, specifically Chapter 10, entitled “Fostering
Productivity Growth through Innovation and Trade,” covers this point in further detail.
2 It is possible that some of the recent decline in productivity growth is due to measurement
issues because official estimates do not count “free” online media and open-source software.
Box 2-5 in Chapter 2 discusses these issues in more detail.

from simply piling more resources (physical or human capital) into the
production process.
The most important source of productivity growth overall is the third
factor—total factor productivity. TFP can be thought of as the way that labor
and capital come together to produce output. For example, imagine taking
the same workers and the same equipment and changing the way that the
workers use the equipment to get more output. Over one-half of the growth
in productivity between 1948 and 2014 came from exactly such changes.
Variations in TFP also explain most of the variations in productivity growth
over longer periods, as the contributions of capital and labor quality have
been roughly constant over time. More recently, however, the contribution
from capital has decreased significantly.3
When TFP increases, a country experiences higher levels of output
even when both the returns to, and the amount used of, capital and labor
remain constant. Such TFP improvements happen when innovators, entrepreneurs, and managers create new products or make improvements to
existing products, often in response to market incentives. This improvement
might happen, for example, if a firm reorganizes the layout of its factory in
a new way so that production lines run more smoothly. Or it might happen

if an inventor uncovers a new method for producing the same output at a
lower cost. Either way, it should be noted that these types of innovations
typically require significant effort and resources.
Sometimes these innovations can be relatively incremental, such
as waste-reducing technology that improves soccer-ball production in
Pakistan (Atkin et al. 2015), or management practices that improve quality and reduce inventory in Indian textile plants (Bloom et al. 2013). Even
though each one is small, many such incremental innovations can lead to
substantial aggregate TFP growth. A recent paper by Garcia-Macia, Hsieh,
and Klenow (2015) estimates that much of the aggregate TFP growth in the
U.S. manufacturing sector from 1992 to 2002 came from incremental innovations, such as product improvements, rather than the creation of entirely
new products. Other times, innovations can have such profound effects on
productivity growth, as was the case with steam and electricity, that their
adoption becomes all but imperative for a firm. In such cases, the innovation
approaches the status of a de facto industry standard. Whether incremental
or transformative, technologies and innovations are critical to ensuring that
the United States maintains and expands on its recent growth.
Competition from new and existing firms plays an important role in
fostering this growth. Startups are a critical pathway for the commercialization of innovative new ideas and products. Startups, or the possibility of
entry by a startup, also create incentives for established firms to innovate
and reduce costs, which in turn drives growth. However, these productivityenhancing channels may be weakening as the rate of new firm formation
has been in persistent decline since the 1970s, as have various measures of
worker mobility and job turnover. The share of patenting by new firms has
also been in decline. At the same time, there are signs of increasing concentration across multiple industries. These trends point to the importance of
removing barriers to entry for inventors and entrepreneurs.
This chapter describes the state of technology and innovation in the
United States, including recent trends, challenges, and opportunities. The
chapter begins by reviewing the recent trajectory of the rate of business
dynamism and labor market dynamism. It then reviews trends in research
and development (R&D) spending and patenting. Finally, it describes in
detail two promising areas that can help the United States to boost TFP
growth in the future—robotics and digital communications technology—as
well as potential challenges posed by these innovations.

Technology and Innovation  |  209

Competition and Dynamism Play a Critical Role
More than 50 years ago, the Nobel Prize-winning economist Kenneth
Arrow (1962) argued that a monopolist may have relatively weak incentives
to innovate since its innovations do not allow it to “steal” business from
competitors. Competition pushes firms to invest in new technologies that
help to lower costs and also to invest in innovations that can lead to quality improvements of existing products.4 Competition can arise in multiple
ways. An incumbent firm can face competition from other incumbents
within the same market that have come up with a new way to produce a
good or service or that have invented a new product that siphons off existing
customers. Or, competition can come from firms new to the market, which
include both startups and established firms. Entry can occur by established
firms in a different product market in the same geography, as happened
when “black cars” (that is, limousine and town car services) entered the taxi
industry in many U.S. cities, or it could involve a firm in a similar product
market but from a different geographic location (Rawley 2010). The latter
case is often what happens with both domestic and international trade (see
Box 5-1 on Trade).

The Role of Startups
Startups are vital to productivity growth in the United States. Startups
are often the way in which a new product or service is first brought to market. A case in point is the small company that Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard
founded in a garage in Palo Alto in 1939, which commercialized an early
version of an electronic oscillator, a vital component in electronic devices.
Hewlett and Packard’s inventions, along with those of multiple other electronics inventors, helped spur the information technology-fueled productivity rebound in the mid-1990s, which saw average labor productivity growth
jump more than a percentage point to 2.4 percent a year (Jorgenson and
Stiroh 2000; Oliner and Sichel 2002).
Academic research finds that entrepreneurship can lead to long-run
productivity growth (e.g., King and Levine 1993), much in the same way that
Hewlett and Packard’s entrepreneurial vision ultimately led to productivity
gains decades after they founded their company. Notably, though personal
computers were becoming widespread in the 1980s and 1990s, there was a lag
until these innovations translated into a meaningful uptick in productivity
4 As noted by many researchers, while some competition is better than none when it comes to
stimulating innovation, there is evidence that too much competition can be detrimental. This
so called inverted-U shape of the relationship between competition and innovation has been
observed across multiple industries (Aghion et al. 2005).

210  |  Chapter 5

Box 5-1: Trade
Domestic and international trade are of critical importance to the
economy overall but also to innovation. Trade promotes innovation and
associated productivity growth in two ways: 1) by increasing the efficiency of the innovation process, thus helping bring more innovations to
market, faster and at lower prices; and 2) by increasing the rewards that
an innovator realizes when his or her new idea succeeds.
Domestic trade—measured by commodity flows between geographies in the United States—is an important driver of U.S. gross domestic
product (GDP) and productivity growth. Infrastructure is important
to domestic trade because it provides the means by which a firm can
efficiently ship its products from one location to another. Chapter 6 of
this Report covers the preconditions for, and consequences of, improving
the quality and quantity of U.S. transportation infrastructure in greater
detail, as well as how the interstate highway, long-distance freight rail,
and air transportation systems are particularly important to productivity. These infrastructure assets also facilitate international trade.
International trade is also an important driver of innovation and
productivity growth. In the words of Nobel Prize-winning economist
Robert Solow (2007), “[r]elatively free trade has the advantage that the
possibility of increasing market share in world markets is a constant
incentive for innovative activity.” One recent review of the evidence calls
the relationship between globalization and productivity growth a “robust
finding” (De Loecker and Goldberg 2014).
International trade can drive productivity growth in several ways.
When U.S. firms sell abroad, they can sell more products per firm, and
this increase in scale may, in some cases, lead to lower costs and higher
productivity. International trade allows companies to access a larger
market, which results in greater revenues and potentially higher profits
for a given level of innovation, and therefore raises the incentive to innovate. For example, recent economic research by Aw, Roberts, and Xu
(2008) finds that firms with experience in foreign markets have a greater
probability of R&D investment. Trade can also generate a positive effect
on aggregate productivity through reallocation. When firms are able to
grow and expand to meet demand from consumers in other countries,
these firms become a larger part of the economy and employ a larger
share of workers. Hence, the reallocation of labor and production toward
more productive firms as they expand after trade liberalization generates
higher aggregate productivity in the economy as a whole (Melitz 2003).
Moreover, trade can expose both exporters and importers to new
ideas and novel tools, materials, or techniques that make them more
productive. Some of this learning is simply copying, as when a firm

Technology and Innovation  |  211

adopts pre-existing technology or know-how. At the same time, since
roughly one-half of all U.S. imports are inputs into the production process, imports can actually reduce firms’ costs by making a greater variety
of goods available at lower prices, and such growth can lead American
businesses to expand production and employment, as highlighted in the
academic literature. Romer (1994) shows that a country’s gains from
international trade are multiplied substantially when the benefits of
cheaper, more varied imported inputs and commodities are taken into
account. Halpern, Koren, and Szeidl (2015) also find that access to a
wider variety of imported inputs following trade liberalization increases
firm productivity. Amiti and Wei (2009) find that imports of service
inputs had a significant positive effect on manufacturing productivity
in the United States between 1992 and 2000. A recent paper by Boler,
Moxnes, and Ulltveit-Moe (2015) demonstrates that improved access
to imported inputs promotes R&D investment and thus technological
innovation.
Finally, trade can also increase competition, which can spur
innovation and productivity growth. Sutton (2012) argues that one of
the pathways through which developed economies benefit from international trade is that entry by competitors at the low end of the productivity
distribution induces innovation in firms at the high end of the productivity distribution. Aghion et al. (2004) studied U.K. firms from 1980 to
1993 and also found large gains in TFP for incumbent firms, in response
to entry by foreign competitors.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the trade agreement between
the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim countries, opens the world’s
fastest-growing markets to U.S. goods and services. The expanded
opportunities for trade created by the TPP will help the most productive U.S. firms expand, make other U.S. firms more productive, and
drive innovation and, ultimately, American productivity. Similarly,
the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP), a trade
agreement currently under negotiation between the United States and
European Union, will help further drive innovation and productivity.

growth. Research also tells us that institutions that protect property rights,
that ensure the availability of affordable credit from healthy financial intermediaries, and that promote the rule of law have historically been important
ingredients for fostering private-sector economic activity and entrepreneurial success (Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson 2005; North and Weingast
1989). Entrepreneurial success ultimately translates into improvements in
quality of life and in productivity growth (King and Levine 1993).

212  |  Chapter 5

In addition to commercializing new technologies, startups provide
jobs. In 2013, startups accounted for over 2 million new jobs compared with
established firms that accounted for over 8 million new jobs.5 However, as
discussed below, the birth rate of startups has been declining over time (see
Figure 5-3). While many startups fail, those that remain in business tend
to grow, creating demand for new jobs. Thus, a healthy environment for
startups sets the stage for current and future job growth.
Most startups rely on a mix of debt and equity financing (Robb and
Robinson 2014), meaning that a healthy, competitive financial system is vital
to ensuring that startups can find the financing they need. Venture capital
investments, both in number of deals and in dollars, provide two indicators
of the health of financial markets for new firms. While such investments continue to lag historical highs from the dot-com boom, these indicators have
improved greatly since the financial crisis in 2008 (see Figure 5-2). Average
quarterly venture capital investment dollars (scaled by GDP) in 2015 were at
a level not seen since 2001, indicating that access to capital for entrepreneurs
and inventors is improving, though capital for innovative startups remains
predominantly available in certain geographies, making high-growth business creation a challenge outside of a handful of metro hubs.
Not only do startups help to commercialize many innovative new
ideas, but also startups—or even the threat of entry by a startup—help to
motivate established businesses to innovate continuously to improve their
existing products (Seamans 2012). This result suggests that an important
function of startups is not only to innovate and commercialize new products, but also to push established firms to do so as well. In fact, there do
not need to be many startups that actively enter into an industry before the
incumbent firms in that industry undertake many changes to enhance productivity or improve consumer welfare. For example, Seamans (2012) shows
that the mere possibility of entry by a city-owned cable system is enough to
induce product upgrades by incumbent cable systems. Thus, this dual role
of startups helps to improve consumer welfare and spur innovation and
productivity growth.

Declining Business Dynamism
While startups are vital to the commercialization of new ideas and
productivity growth, entry by startups has been declining in the United
States since the late 1970s. With exit rates relatively constant, this trend
means that the average age of U.S. firms is increasing, while the number of
firms is declining. Business dynamism—the so-called churn or birth and
death rates of firms—has been in persistent decline in the United States since

the 1970s (as shown in Figure 5-3). Moreover, whereas in the 1980s and
1990s declining dynamism was observed in selected sectors, notably retail,
the decline was observed across all sectors in the 2000s, including the traditionally high-growth information technology sector (Decker et al. 2014).
This trend likely has some relationship to contemporaneous declines
in productivity and innovation, though the direction of that relationship
is not so clear. A decline in innovation and productivity may be leading to
fewer entrants and successful challenges to incumbents, or some exogenous
factor—for example, a business environment that limits competition or
erects barriers to entry (see Box 5-2 on Occupational Licensing below)—
may be driving lower rates of new firm formation that then result in lower
levels of innovation. Lower rates of firm entry may be reducing the kind of
competition among firms that usually leads them to innovate and improve
their efficiency, thus weighing on total factor productivity growth.	
The reasons for declining firm entry rates are not well understood,
but the trend has been downward for nearly four decades. A partial explanation is that barriers to entry have increased in many industries. For some
industries, these barriers could be in the form of occupational licenses (see
Box 5-2 on Occupational Licensing). In other cases, these barriers could be
in the form of Federal, State, or local licenses or permits. Oftentimes these

licenses and permits are designed to ensure that businesses comply with
important consumer safety rules. For example, restaurants in New York City
are required to have a manager who has passed a Food Protection Course.6
Such regulations add fixed costs to an entrepreneur wanting to open a new
business but oftentimes serve a valuable role in protecting public well-being.
In other cases, the barriers to entry may be related to various advantages that have accrued to incumbent firms over time. These could be political in nature; for example, existing firms could lobby for rules protecting
them from new entrants, as have been seen in the case of the taxi and limousine industry, where Internet-based applications from new entrants have
recently begun to disrupt the local ride-for-hire sector. The barriers could
also be related to economies of scale, whereby the incumbent has become
so large that it has effectively foreclosed on the viability of entry by another
firm. Some industries, such as power transmission, water, and other utilities,
have natural monopolies, which occur when the fixed costs are very high,
and marginal costs are low and approaching zero. Some newer technology
markets in which network effects are important, such as social media sites,
may come to be dominated by one firm, because the network externalities in
these markets tip to one provider of the network good.

Box 5-2: Occupational Licensing
One factor that may be contributing to the broad-based decline in
the fluidity of the economy in the last several decades, including declining firm entry rates, less worker fluidity, and less job turnover, is the
increasing prevalence of occupational licensing rules. This phenomenon
can create barriers to entry for firms and workers in a market or geographic location, thus limiting competition and potentially generating
other market distortions. Work by Kleiner and Krueger (2013) charting
the historical growth in licensing from a number of different data sources
shows that the share of the U.S. workforce covered by state licensing
laws grew fivefold in the second half of the 20th century, from less than
5 percent in the early 1950s to 25 percent by 2008 (Figure 5-i below).
Although state licenses account for the bulk of licensing, the addition
of local- and Federal-licensed occupations further raises the share of the
workforce that was licensed in 2008 to 29 percent.
While part of this increase in the percent of licensed workers is
due to employment growth within certain heavily licensed fields such
as health care and education, it is primarily due to an increase in the
number of occupations that require a license. Analysis by the Council of
Economic Advisers (CEA) finds that roughly two-thirds of the growth
in the proportion of workers licensed at the State level from the 1960s
to 2008 is attributable to growth in the number of licensed occupations,

while a little over one-third is due to changes in the occupational composition of the workforce (CEA et al. 2015).
When designed and implemented carefully, licensing can offer
important health and safety protections to consumers and the public,
as well as benefits to workers. However, some occupational licensing
regimes can present a classic case of so-called rent-seeking behavior by
incumbents, whereby these individuals and firms may successfully lobby
government entities to erect entry barriers to would-be competitors that
result in higher-than-normal returns to capital and labor. In addition,
licensing requirements vary substantially by state—both in terms of
which professions require licenses and the requirements for obtaining a
license—making it more difficult for workers to move across state lines.
Thus, it is possible that the steady increase in the number of licensed
workers is contributing to the United States’ decades-long decrease in
interstate mobility, though it is unlikely that licensing is the main driver
of this change (CEA et al. 2015).
Land use regulations and zoning can also make it more difficult for
entrepreneurs to start new firms or for workers to move to more productive cities and firms. See Box 2-6 in Chapter 2 for discussion of the effects
that result from overly restrictive land use regulations.

Whether a cause or consequence of declining firm entry rates, market
concentration appears to have risen over the same time period. The U.S.
Census Bureau’s data on market consolidation, tabulated in a recent paper
by Furman and Orszag (2015), shows a clear trend of consolidation in the
nonfarm business sector. The data show that, in three-fourths of the broad
sectors for which data are available, the 50 largest firms gained revenue share
between 1997 and 2007. Their paper also highlights results from a number of
independent studies that have documented increased market concentration
across industries including agriculture, upstream agricultural supply, banking, hospitals, and wireless telecommunications.
To the extent that industries look more like oligopolies than perfectly
competitive markets, meaning that some firms dominate the market and
possess certain advantages, they will generate economic rents (Furman
and Orszag 2015). Economic rents are returns to a factor of production,
like capital or land, which exceed the level needed to bring that factor into
production; in other words, returns in excess of the level expected based on
economic fundamentals. Economic rents are split between firms and their
workers, but firms with higher market power have greater leverage to retain
rents, either by charging high prices or by paying their workers less. In the
absence of some countervailing public purpose, such rents reflect a decrease
Technology and Innovation  |  217

in consumer welfare as they erode the surplus that would otherwise accrue
to consumers and workers in a competitive market; for example, through
lower prices for goods or higher wages from their employees. Moreover,
absent entry or threat of entry by startups, incumbents in these concentrated
industries have less incentive to innovate, leading to lower productivity
growth in the long run.

Declining Labor Market Dynamism
Business dynamism is directly connected to labor market dynamism
(or fluidity or churn), which refers to the frequency of changes in who is
working for whom in the labor market—a topic that was covered in detail in
Chapter 3 of the 2015 Economic Report of the President. From the worker’s
perspective, fluidity is measured by hires and separations; from the firm’s
perspective, it is measured by new positions (job creation) and eliminated
positions (job destruction) (Council of Economic Advisers 2015a).
Figure 5-4 illustrates that both job creation and job destruction as a
share of total employment have been in continuous decline since 1980 but
that job creation has fallen faster in the last two decades. This trend can
be explained in part by the decline in business dynamism. There are fewer
young firms in the economy today than in the 1980s. Young firms that survive grow faster than older, established firms. Having fewer young firms thus
delays recovery after recessions, accounting for part of the reason why job
creation has fallen throughout this period. The rate of job destruction has
fallen more slowly over the same timeframe in part because older firms are
more resilient to macroeconomic shocks and other sudden, adverse events
(Decker et al. 2014).
Lower rates of job creation and destruction may be contributing to
reduced churn in the labor market and affecting the process by which workers find jobs best matched to their skills and vice versa, lowering overall productivity for all firms—young and old. Workers and firms alike benefit when
there is a good match between the worker’s skillset and the task required of
him or her by the firm. This skillset-job match leads to cost savings, some of
which may be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices, some of
which may be enjoyed by the worker in the form of higher wages, and some
of which is retained by the firm via higher profits.
Thus, existing firms can increase their productivity by hiring workers with specific know-how or technological skills, or skills that better fit
the jobs at a particular firm. The supply of such workers available to meet
firms’ demand, however, is limited in three ways. Know-how or skills may
be acquired through schools and training programs, but it can take years
to complete such educational programs, resulting in a lag between when

firms first signal demand to the labor market and when individuals who
have made decisions to join educational programs are ready to enter the
workforce.
Another way high-skill workers may enter the labor market is through
immigration, the total volume of which is limited by the number of visas
granted, which is capped by legislation. Recent evidence shows that the
contribution of skilled migration to innovation has been substantial. For
example, Peri, Shih, and Sparber (2014) find that inflows of foreign science,
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workers explain between
30 and 50 percent of the aggregate productivity growth that took place in
the United States between 1990 and 2010. There is also abundant anecdotal
evidence that the contribution of immigrants to innovation, entrepreneurship and education is substantial in the United States. Immigrants accounted
for about one-quarter of U.S.-based Nobel Prize recipients between 1990
and 2000. Immigrants were also among the key founders for one-quarter
of all U.S. technology and engineering companies started between 1995 and
2005 with at least 1 million dollars in sales in 2006 and for over half of such
companies in Silicon Valley (Wadhwa et al. 2007). These authors also report
that 24 percent of all patents originating from the United States are authored
by non-citizens.

Technology and Innovation  |  219

Finally, some workers may acquire skills on the job that then may be
useful in future employment. Many firms, however, require their employees
to sign non-compete agreements, which provide another constraint on the
mobility of highly skilled workers. Removing such restrictions should lead
to higher levels of labor-market dynamism such that workers are better able
to find jobs matched to their skills, which should in turn lead to higher labor
productivity. Recent studies suggest that the high concentrations of entrepreneurship in states like California are due to these states’ non-enforcement
of non-compete agreements (Gilson 1999; Marx, Singh, and Fleming 2015).
The implications of reductions in labor and firm dynamism are less
clear than the trends themselves. Reduced dynamism may be a sign of better
matching in job markets to begin with or increased efforts by existing firms
to reduce employee turnover. Yet, reduced flows may be the result of real
reductions in innovation by new firms—which is discussed below—that are
driving both reduced firm and labor market dynamism. Another source of
both reductions may be an expansion of non-compete clauses, occupational
licensing, and other labor market institutions that preclude employees from
switching jobs or starting their own businesses. Increased concentration in
many industries may also play a role, regardless of its cause.

Trends in R&D Spending and Patenting
Innovation is difficult to measure directly, but spending on research
and development is a critical input into innovation, and one that can be
closely tracked over time. Another indirect proxy that is often used by
researchers is the number of patents granted annually. This section considers both of these measures.

The Growth of Private R&D and Decline of Public R&D
Basic research discoveries often have great social value because of
their broad applicability. However, because it is difficult for a private firm to
appropriate the gains from basic research, there tends to be underinvestment
in basic research by private firms, in the absence of public investment. As a
result, economic theory predicts that aggregate R&D investment (comprised
not only of basic research but also of applied research and experimental
development) is bound to fall short of what is socially optimal (Nelson 1959).
Recent empirical analyses that attempt to measure spillover effects suggest
that the socially optimal level of R&D investment—the amount that would
produce the greatest rate of economic growth—is two to four times greater
than actual spending (Jones and Williams 1998; Bloom, Schankerman, and

220  |  Chapter 5

Van Reenen 2013), and that underinvestment is particularly acute in the area
of basic research (Akcigit et al. 2012).
Investing in science and technology has been one of President
Obama’s priorities, and these investments have included major new research
initiatives such as the Precision Medicine Initiative and BRAIN Initiative
(see Box 5-3 on Major Research Initiatives). Since the President took office
in 2009, private R&D spending has risen as a share of the economy, reaching its highest share on record, while public R&D has fallen as a share of the
economy in part due to harmful budget cuts like the sequester, as shown
in Figure 5-5. In total, R&D has grown from 2.37 percent of GDP in 2004
to an estimated 2.62 percent of GDP in 2015.7 Under the Consolidated
Appropriations Act of 2016, funding for Federal R&D in FY 2016 will rise
by $11.2 billion (8.1 percent) above FY 2015 levels, according to analysis by
the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
Private R&D investment growth has been faster during the current
recovery (post 2008) than in the prior economic expansion (2001-07), and
has been especially strong in the 2013-15 period. As indicated in Figure
5-6, private R&D investment has grown at an average annual rate of 3.5
percent during the current recovery, faster than the average annual pace of
3.0 percent during the previous expansion between 2001 and 2007. Since the
beginning of 2013, R&D has grown 4.9 percent at an average annual rate.
Based on data available as of this writing, 2015 was the best year for private
R&D growth since 2008.
Private business accounts for virtually all of the recent growth in R&D.
Nonprofit institutions like universities had a negligible impact on growth.
The manufacturing sector is an important driver of R&D. In 2013 and
2014, manufacturing accounted for roughly 75 percent of R&D growth and
non-manufacturing accounted for the other 25 percent (see Table 5-1). Two
manufacturing sectors that have notably improved relative to the pre-crisis
time period (2001–2007) are semiconductors and electronic components
and motor vehicles and parts. In addition, manufacturing employs 60 percent of U.S. R&D employees and accounts for more than two thirds of total
7 There is substantial variation in the measurement of R&D depending upon the source
consulted. This chapter relies upon data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA),
which have the advantage of being available for 2015 as of this writing. However, BEA data
do not include private firms’ outlays for software development. As a result, BEA data tend to
underestimate R&D’s share of GDP by roughly 0.1 percentage point as compared with data
from the NSF, with the size of the underestimate growing in recent years. There is, however,
a significant lag in the availability of NSF R&D funding data. The Battelle forecast attempts to
update the latest available data from the National Science Foundation (2013) and the Census
Bureau with forecasts based on more recent micro data from other sources. The most recent
forecast from the Battelle Memorial Institute projects a U.S. R&D/GDP ratio of 2.8 percent in
2014, close to its all-time highs (Grueber and Studt 2013).

Box 5-3: Major Research Initiatives
The President’s FY 2017 Budget builds on seven years’ worth of the
Administration’s science and technology priorities in a variety of policycritical domains. Specific attention in Federal R&D funding has been
paid to those societal needs that are susceptible to the classic problem of
private underinvestment in public goods. In other words, many of the
areas that the Administration has identified for concerted Federal R&D
investment efforts are those in which individual firms or investors have
limited economic incentive to commit resources, even though the overall
societal benefits of these investments would be substantial. Basic research
comprises a large portion of efforts that are prone to this problem.
One major area of Federal focus is the effort to combat global
climate change and promote clean energy technological development,
as outlined in the President’s Climate Action Plan, the U.S. Global
Climate Change Research Program Strategic Plan, and the Department
of Energy’s Quadrennial Technology Review. Detailed in these documents is the Administration’s emphasis on renewable energy and electric
grid modernization, the potential for improved efficiency in buildings
and industry, investments in smart, multi-modal and electrified transportation systems, and technology development that would reduce
greenhouse gas emissions while also improving resilience. Also relevant
in this domain is an emphasis on improving our understanding of ocean
and Arctic issues.
Another area of attention centers on the life sciences. Agencies
have been instructed to prioritize research that could lead to positive
impacts on health, energy, and food security. Chief among such priorities are the BRAIN Initiative, efforts to combat antibiotic resistance, and
initiatives to improve our bio-surveillance capabilities. Mental healthrelated research, especially that which assists our country’s veterans, is
also of high priority. A final area of commitment is the Administration’s
Precision Medicine Initiative, which seeks to tailor medical care to the
needs of the individual patient. Accordingly, investments that improve
a patient’s usability and portability of his or her own electronic medical
records are of particular interest, subject to robust privacy controls.
A final cluster of major research initiatives involves advanced
technologies, including those that bolster the Nation’s security, including
cybersecurity, and those that support advanced manufacturing. Such
efforts focus on nanotechnology, robotics, advanced materials, bioengineering, and high-performance computing, as well as more specific
national security research priorities in the domain of data analysis,
hypersonics, and counter-proliferation. Many of these initiatives involve
investing in the “industries of the future,” as the development and appli-

222  |  Chapter 5

cation of these technologies may yield general purpose technologies with
the potential to create entirely new industries, build jobs, and increase
productivity.
Ultimately, investments in these research initiatives will both
improve consumer welfare and drive productivity growth in the
American economy. The resultant improvements in our capacity to
combat climate change, the quality of the Nation’s health care, and the
effectiveness of our national security efforts will form the backbone of an
innovation ecosystem that benefits workers and consumers.

R&D volume in the United States. Manufacturing is also responsible for the
vast majority of U.S. patents issued (Sperling 2013).
Federal R&D spending can be decomposed into defense and nondefense R&D spending, as displayed in Figure 5-7. Compared to most of
the last decade, both defense and non-defense R&D funding have dropped
slightly as a percentage of GDP in this decade. As a result of the one-time
boost from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), Federal
R&D funding approached 1.0 percent of GDP in fiscal years 2009-10; however, subsequent Congressional appropriations have failed to maintain these
gains.
The decline in federally funded R&D is potentially consequential
because Federal and industry R&D investments should be thought of as
complements and not substitutes for each other. The Federal R&D portfolio
is somewhat balanced between research and development, while industry
R&D predominantly focuses on later-stage product development. Figure
5-8 shows that the Federal Government is the majority supporter of basic
research—the so-called “seed corn” of future innovations and industries
that generates the largest spillovers and thus is at risk of being the most
underfunded in a private market—and, as such, the Administration’s efforts
have prioritized increasing Federal investments in basic research while also
pushing for an overall increase in Federal R&D investment.
In absolute terms, the United States is the largest R&D investor in the
world, with a share of about 30 percent of world R&D spending forecasted
in 2014 (though second-place China is rapidly gaining share, it is only at
18 percent) (Grueber and Studt 2013). However, measured as a share of
the economy, the United States ranks 10th in R&D among countries in the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (see Figure
5-9). Unlike the United States, most of the other economies in the top 10

continue to expand their R&D investments from all sources—not just private ones—faster than their economic growth.8
Federal R&D is important not only for private firms’ success, job
creation, or aggregate measures of productivity. Federally funded research
leads to innovations that improve consumer welfare as well, with a host of
products and services being made possible by such investments—be they in
the area of basic or applied research investigations. From Google Earth and
global positioning systems to microwave ovens, and from vaccinations to
photovoltaic cells, discoveries and products enabled by U.S. Federal investments in innovation have touched lives across the globe in ways that are
likely to be understated in official growth and productivity statistics (see
Chapter 2). Investments in R&D are therefore important to the health of the
American economy as well as to general welfare. The innovations that these

investments in R&D generate help lower costs and boost productivity, and
the firms that these investments spawn compete with established firms, further driving innovation and productivity growth (Griliches 1986; Griliches
1992; Jones 2002; Jones and Williams 1998).

Recent Trends in Patenting
Although innovation is notoriously difficult to quantify, patents provide one measure of innovative activity. The link between patent grants and
aggregate productivity growth is tenuous, because patenting can be driven
by numerous factors, including the budget of the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office (Griliches 1989). Thus, while the number of new patents granted has
increased over the past several decades (Figure 5-10, right axis), the extent
to which this trend is indicative of current or future productivity growth is
unclear.
Recent academic findings at the firm level, however, suggest that
higher levels of patenting are associated with higher total factor productivity. For example, Balasubramanian and Sivadasan (2011) find evidence that
a firm’s productivity increases following its first patent. The U.S. Census
Bureau and U.S. Patent and Trademark Office have started to link patent
application data to administrative data on firms and workers. Initial research
using this data indicates that most patenting firms are small, and that firms

that patent are responsible for creating more jobs and shedding fewer jobs
than non-patenting firms (Graham et al. 2015). Given evidence of slowing
business dynamism and lower rates of entry by new firms discussed in the
previous section, these new findings would then suggest that the share of
patents by new firms is slowing over time. Figure 5-10 (left axis) graphs
the percent of patents by first-time patent applicants (many of which are
young or startup firms) from 1976 to 2003. While patenting has increased
over time, the percent of patents by first-time applicants has been declining
since the late 1980s, implying at the very least that the majority of the recent
increase in the overall number of patents in the U.S. economy is likely not
driven by first-timers.
The reasons behind the falling share of first-time patent applicants are
not well understood. It may be that there are economies to scale in patenting,
and so larger firms are patenting at a higher rate than startups. It may be
that younger firms are starting to rely on trade secrets rather than patents;
indeed, Png (2015) provides evidence that trade secrets may substitute for
patents in some industries. It may be that costs associated with litigation
disproportionately affect young firms (see Box 5-4 on Patent Litigation).
Strong institutions that protect property rights are an important
ingredient for fostering economic activity and entrepreneurial success
(Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson 2005; North and Weingast 1989). But

Box 5-4: Patent Legislation
While the number of annual patent grants have increased dramatically over the past several decades (Figure 5-10 above), so too has
the amount of patent litigation (Figure 5-ii below, left axis). The rate of
patent litigation, defined as the ratio of the number of patent litigation
cases to the number of in-force patents, increased from the 1970s to mid1990s, then fell from the mid-1990s to 2010, before increasing through
2014. (Figure 5-ii below, right axis). Some of the increase in patent
litigation occurred after the America Invents Act (AIA) took effect in
2011. Part of the increase may have been due to the AIA’s change in the
“joinder rule” that previously allowed multiple cases involving a single
infringed patent to be joined. Part of the increase may have also been due
to a temporary increase in false marking cases (PWC 2013).
Patent litigation cases are brought by both non-practicing entities
(NPEs) and practicing entities (PEs). NPEs are organizations that own
patents on products or processes but do not make, use, or sell them.
These include patent assertion entities (PAEs) that specialize in asserting patents, as well as individual inventors and universities who solely
license patents to others (Lemley and Melamed 2013). PEs are organizations that own patents on products or processes that they make, use, or
sell. According to research by RPX (2014; 2015), the percent of patent
litigation cases brought by NPEs has grown over time, from below 30

NPE cases are filed by PAEs, estimated to be 89 percent of all NPE cases
by RPX (2015).
Patent litigation appears to negatively affect entrepreneurship
and innovation. Chien (2015) reports that patent litigation disproportionately affects smaller companies. Kiebzak, Rafert, and Tucker (2016)
conclude that venture capital investment, an indicator of levels of
entrepreneurial activity, initially increases with the number of litigated
patents, but that past a certain threshold, further increases in litigated
patents are associated with decreased venture capital investment. The
authors also find some evidence that a similar relationship exists between
patent litigation and small firm entry. Scott Morton and Shapiro (2014)
develop a theoretical model to assess how patent litigation affects innovation. When they fit the model with existing data, the results suggest
that patent litigation hurts innovation. Feldman and Lemley (2015) find
that very few patent license demands lead to new innovation but rather
involve payment by the licensee to continue with its business. Galasso
and Schankerman (2015) exploit the randomized assignment of judges
to find that patent invalidation results in a 50 percent decrease in future
patenting over a five-year window.

property rights protection regimes must balance addressing valid concerns
with guarding against baseless or excessive complaints. This tradeoff is
particularly important as the frequency of patent litigation has risen. With
this goal in mind, the President has supported efforts to reform the U.S. patent system, including signing the America Invents Act (AIA) in September
2011. Among other changes called for in the AIA, there are now limits on
the ability of patent holders to name (or “join”) multiple defendants in a
single patent infringement lawsuit. More work is needed to reform patent
litigation and better align rewards provided to patent holders with their
social contribution. By instituting reforms that better protect and incentivize
innovators, motivate more entrepreneurial startups to enter and compete
against established firms, and encourage workers to seek employment
opportunities that are best matched to their skillset, the Administration aims
to foster productivity growth.

New Opportunities and Challenges
There are many opportunities for new technologies and business models to spur innovation and productivity growth. The range of

230  |  Chapter 5

technologies—from clean energy technology to biotechnology to 3-D
printing technology—is broad. This section focuses on two new opportunities that have the potential for broad spillovers into different parts of the
economy. One area is the rapidly growing field of robotics. The other area
involves Internet communications technology. While these areas offer much
promise, there are also a variety of challenges that result from their deployment and increasing role in American life. For example, it is important that
the resultant gains from productivity growth from these technologies are
shared widely.
More specifically, in the area of robotics, this section explores concerns
that increased automation in the workplace threatens to displace elements
of the conventional labor force. It is important to keep in mind that, while
growing quickly, robotics are not poised to affect every area of the economy
or replace human labor. Nonetheless, robotics still have the potential to be
highly consequential for firms and, more broadly, for productivity.
This section also discusses two particular facets of Internet communications technology, namely the on-demand economy and the digital divide.
The rise of the so-called on-demand economy—enabled by mobile Internet
applications—also has the potential for productivity and welfare gains but
could possibly lead to worker displacement, a prospect that is examined here
as well. This section also emphasizes the need to narrow what is commonly
called the digital divide—the gap between those who can access the Internet
and those who cannot—so that all may share in its benefits, the existence of
which is well-supported by empirical findings in the economics literature.

Robotics
One area of innovation that can help the United States to boost TFP
growth in the future is robotics. The first U.S. robots were introduced into
production by General Motors in 1961, and their prevalence has grown
steadily over time, particularly in manufacturing and the auto industry
(Gordon 2012). Recently, the deployment of robots has accelerated, leading
them to contribute more to productivity, as described below. However, these
changes potentially also create challenges in labor markets as concerns have
arisen about the extent to which robots will displace workers from their jobs.
An economy must carefully assess these developments to encourage innovation but also to provide adequate training and protections for workers.
The use of industrial robots can be thought of as a specific form of
automation. As a characteristic of innovation for centuries, automation
enhances production processes from flour to textiles to virtually every
product in the market. Automation, including through the use of information technology, is widely believed to foster increased productivity growth
Technology and Innovation  |  231

(Bloom, Sadun, and Van Reenen 2012). In many cases, mostly for higherskilled work, automation has resulted in substantial increases in living standards and leisure time. The International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) defines a robot to be an “actuated mechanism programmable in two
or more axes with a degree of autonomy, moving within its environment, to
perform intended tasks.”9 This degree of autonomy makes robotic automation somewhat different from historical examples of automation, such as
the replacement of weavers with looms. Some of these machines can operate
for extended periods of time without human control, presaging the rise of a
potentially paradigm-shifting innovation in the productivity process.
Robots, like other types of automation, can be either complements to,
or substitutes for, conventional labor. For example, at many of the country’s
biggest container shipping ports—the primary gateways to and from the
United States for waterborne international shipments—automation has
replaced longshoremen in a variety of activities, from computerized cargo
management platforms that allow for visualization of the loading of a container ship in real time to software that allows for end-to-end management
of individual containers throughout the unloading process (Feuer 2012).
By contrast, there are a number of “smart warehouse” applications that
involve varying amounts of automation to complement the work done by
warehouse fulfillment workers. Examples include LED lights on shelves that
light up when a worker reaches the appropriate location and mobile robots
that bring inventory from the floor to a central place for packaging (Field
2015; Garfield 2016). The latter example realigns employees away from
product-retrieval tasks and focuses them instead on the inventory-sorting
phase of the process, for which humans have a comparative advantage over
machinery.
Robotics have also played an important role in growth over the last
two decades. A recent study estimates that robotics added an average of 0.37
percentage point to a country’s annual GDP growth between 1993 and 2007,
accounting for about one-tenth of GDP growth during this time period
(Graetz and Michaels 2015). This same study also estimates that robotics
added 0.36 percentage point to labor productivity growth, accounting for
about 16 percent of labor productivity growth during this time period. This
effect is of similar magnitude to the impact that the advent of steam engines
had on labor productivity growth (Crafts 2004).

9 Note that the requirement for a “degree of autonomy” can be fulfilled with anything
from indirect interaction between human control inputs and the physical robot all
the way up to full autonomy (ISO 8373, 2012, available at https://www.iso.org/obp/
ui/#iso:std:iso:8373:ed-2:v1:en).

Growth in robotics shipments has increased since 2007, suggesting
that robotics may contribute even more to GDP and labor productivity
growth in the future, though it is too early to tell. As indicated in Figure
5-11, from 2010 to 2014, worldwide shipments of industrial robotics have
nearly doubled, according to the International Federation of Robotics (IFR).
Research by the Boston Consulting Group also estimates that the dollar
value of these industrial robotics shipments likely doubled during this time
period (Sander and Wolfgang 2014). These estimates may even understate
the pace of growth, since the IFR defines an industrial robot by ISO standard 8373: “An automatically controlled, reprogrammable, multipurpose
manipulator programmable in three or more axes, which may be either fixed
in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications.” In particular, the requirement that the device be reprogrammable to be considered an
industrial robot may result in an undercount compared to other robotics
definitions.
Industrial-services robots are primarily applied to manufacturing
activities. The automotive sector accounts for approximately 40 percent of
total robot shipments worldwide, and has seen rapid growth in shipments
since 2010. Consumer electronics is the second-largest sector, comprising 20
percent of total shipments; other large sectors include chemical rubber and
plastics, metal, and food processing, as indicated in Figure 5-12.

Robotics are used in different ways across different industries. Figure
5-12 depicts changes over time within several industries and, in particular,
highlights the rapid growth within the automotive industry. Another way to
compare the intensity of robot use across industries is to normalize the number of robot units in the industry by the number of workers in the industry
to create a “robot density.” Figure 5-13 compares the robot density across
industries and across countries. Again, the automotive industry appears to
be the heaviest user of robots, both in terms of absolute number of robot
units (shown in Figure 5-12) and in terms of density of robots per worker
(illustrated by Figure 5-13). This trend may be because the skillset of robots
lends itself well to the standardization and fixed nature of the automotive
assembly process. The comparison also reveals that the United States lags
Japan and Germany in the number of robots per worker, especially outside
the automotive sector.
To examine the pace of innovation in robotics, CEA collected data
directly from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on the total number of
patents granted each year, as well as the number of robotics patents, from
2000 to 2014.10 Figure 5-14 shows that the number of patents in this class

was relatively flat through the 2000s, before starting to increase in 2012.
There were close to 350 robotics patents granted in both 2013 and 2014,
as compared to an average of about 150 in the 2000s. As also indicated in
Figure 5-14, the share of patents that are for robotics decreased from 2006
to 2010 before starting to increase from 2011 to 2014.
CEA also conducted an analysis of patent ownership and found little
evidence of concentrated ownership across industries. However, robotics
are used differently across industries, and so it is unclear whether there is
a concentration of patent ownership within different industries. Going forward, it will be important to be vigilant about intellectual property related to
robotics. Low concentration in upstream markets implies healthy competition, which should lead to more innovation and lower prices. As a result,
downstream firms should be able to acquire robot inputs at competitive
prices, which should help to drive productivity growth even further.

Effect of Robotics on Workers
While industrial robots have the potential to drive productivity
growth in the United States, it is less clear how this growth will affect
workers. One view is that robots will take substantial numbers of jobs away
from humans, leaving them technologically unemployed—either in blissful
leisure or, in many popular accounts, suffering from the lack of a job. Most
economists consider either scenario unlikely because several centuries of
innovation have shown that, even as machines have been able to increasingly do tasks humans used to do, this leads humans to have higher incomes,
consume more, and creates jobs for almost everyone who wants them. In
other words, as workers have historically been displaced by technological
innovations, they have moved into new jobs, often requiring more complex
tasks or greater levels of independent judgment.
A critical question, however, is the pace at which this happens and the
labor market institutions facilitate the shifting of people to new jobs. As an
extreme example, if a new innovation rendered one-half of the jobs in the
economy obsolete next year, then the economy might be at full employment
in the “long run.” But this long run could be decades away as workers are
slowly retrained and as the current cohort of workers ages into retirement
and is replaced by younger workers trained to find jobs amidst the new
technological opportunities. If, however, these jobs were rendered obsolete
over many decades then it is much less likely that it would result in largescale, “transitional” unemployment. Nevertheless, labor market institutions
are critical here too, and the fact that the percentage of men ages 25-54
employed in the United States slowly but steadily declined since the 1950s,
as manufacturing has shifted to services, suggests that challenges may arise.
236  |  Chapter 5

Over time, economists expect wages to adjust to clear the labor market
and workers to respond to incentives to develop human capital. Inequality
could increase; indeed, most economists believe technological change is
partially responsible for rising inequality in recent decades. Whether or not
robots will increase or decrease inequality depends in part on the extent to
which robots are complements to, or substitutes for, labor. If substitution
dominates, then the question becomes whether or not labor has enough
bargaining power such that it can share in productivity gains. At present,
this question cannot be answered fully, largely because of limited research
on the economic impact of robots. One of the few studies in this area finds
that higher levels of robot density within an industry lead to higher wages
in that industry (Graetz and Michaels 2015), suggesting that robots are
complements to labor. The higher wages, however, might be due in part
to robots’ replacing lower-skill workers in that industry, thus biasing wage
estimates upwards.
The older literature on automation may give some clues about how
robots will affect jobs in the future. This broader literature finds that, while
there is some substitution of automation for human labor, complementary
jobs are often created and new work roles emerge to develop and maintain
the new technology (Autor 2015). One issue is whether these new jobs
are created fast enough to replace the lost jobs. Keynes (1930) appears to
have been concerned about the prospect for what he termed “technological
unemployment,” borne out of the notion that societies are able to improve
labor efficiency more quickly than they are able to find new uses for labor.
There has been some debate about which types of workers are most
affected by automation. That is, jobs are not necessarily destroyed by
automation but instead are reallocated. Autor and Dorn (2013) argue that
so-called middle-skill jobs are what get displaced by automation and robots.
These jobs, which have historically included bookkeepers, clerks, and certain assembly-line workers, are relatively easy to routinize. This results in
middle-skill workers who cannot easily acquire training for a higher-skilled
job settling for a position that requires a lower-skill level, which may then
translate into lower wages. In contrast, high-skill jobs that use problemsolving capabilities, intuition and creativity, and low-skill jobs that require
situational adaptability and in-person interactions, are less easy to routinize.
Autor, Levy, and Murnane (2003) point out that robots and computerization
have historically not been able to replicate or automate these tasks, which
has led to labor market polarization. While not specifically tied to automation, Goos, Manning, and Salomons (2014) find broad evidence of this labor
market polarization across European countries.

Technology and Innovation  |  237

In contrast, recent papers by Autor (2015) and Schmitt, Shierholz, and
Mishel (2013) suggests that the labor market polarization seen in the 1980s
and 1990s may be declining. Data from the 2000s suggests that lower- and
middle-skill workers have experienced less employment and wage growth
than higher-skilled workers. Frey and Osborne (2013) argue that big data
and machine learning will make it possible to automate many tasks that
were difficult to automate in the past. In a study specifically on robots and
jobs, Graetz and Michaels (2015) find some evidence that higher levels of
robot density within an industry lead to fewer hours worked by low-skilled
workers in that industry.
While robotics is likely to affect industrial sectors of the economy differently, it also is likely to affect occupations within these sectors differently.
Two recent studies have used data on occupational characteristics to study
how automation might differentially affect wages across occupations (Frey
and Osborne 2013; McKinsey Global Institute 2015). Both studies rely on
the detailed occupational descriptions from O*NET, an occupational data
source funded by the U.S. Department of Labor, to derive probabilities that
an occupation will be automated into obsolescence. While the two studies
have slightly different categorizations, they both find a negative relationship
between wages and the threat of automation.
To better understand the relationship between automation and wages
at the occupational level, CEA matched an occupation’s median hourly wage
to the occupational automation scores from Frey and Osborne (2013). The
median probability of automation was then calculated for three ranges of
hourly wage: less than 20 dollars; 20 to 40 dollars; and more than 40 dollars.
The results, presented in Figure 5-15, suggest that occupations that are easier
to automate have lower wages. Low probability of outright automation,
however, would seem to make an occupation a better candidate for being
complemented and improved by automation in the workplace (such as the
role played by e-mail, statistical analysis, and computerized computation for
a variety of office-based jobs) and so are not as prone to seeing an effect on
wages from increased automation.
These data demonstrate the need for a robust training and education
agenda, to ensure that displaced workers are able to quickly and smoothly
move into new jobs. The bipartisan Workforce Innovation and Opportunity
Act, which President Obama signed into law in July 2014, consolidates
existing funding initiatives, helps retrain workers in skills that employers are looking for, and matches those workers to employers. In March
2015, the Administration launched the TechHire initiative, part of which
aims to equip 17-29 year olds with skills necessary for jobs in information

Internet and New Business Models
Digital communications technology is an area that has had a large
impact on TFP growth. Such technologies are what some economists call
General Purpose or “platform” technologies, meaning that improvements
in communication technologies stimulate innovation across a wide variety
of other sectors. This growth is expected to continue in the future as the
Internet is used to connect employers to employees, to connect customers
to suppliers, and to develop new businesses and business models that deliver
products and services faster than in the past. Moreover, these new businesses
compete with established firms, in many cases pushing existing businesses
to innovate further, thereby providing customers with better products and
services at lower prices. Competition can therefore lead to higher living standards, as customers can purchase a wider variety of products at lower prices.
The United States is among the world leaders in the development and
deployment of cutting-edge broadband technology. Today, most Americans
live in areas served by fixed-line Internet services, and the United States
enjoys widespread availability of advanced wireless broadband Internet
Technology and Innovation  |  239

services, such as 4G LTE. At the same time, broadband access has become
a nearly indispensable component of modern life. Numerous studies show
that access to broadband contributes to local, regional, and national economic growth. A study of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) countries finds that a 10 percentage-point increase
in broadband penetration is associated with per capita income growth rates
that are between 0.9 and 1.5 percentage points higher (Czernich, Falck,
Kretschmer, and Woessmann 2011). Another cross-country analysis finds
that a 1 percent increase in the size of a country’s Internet-using population is associated with 8 to 15 dollars more in GDP per capita (Najarzadeh,
Rahimzadeh, and Reed 2014). Kolko (2012), using panel data and instrumental variables approaches, finds that local broadband expansion leads to
local employment growth.
These findings parallel a broad literature linking Internet and communications technology (ICT) to productivity. For example, Bartel, Ichniowski,
and Shaw (2007) find that computerized numerically controlled machining
centers can both lead to wider product variety and improve overall production efficiency. More generally, growth in the use of computers, as well as
the changes in management and other organizational dynamics that ensued,
partially explains the recovery in TFP growth during the 1990s from its
historic lows in the 1970s and 1980s (Black and Lynch 2004). While the
United States benefited from the integration of these technologies and management techniques, other countries that also invested in ICT did not see as
large a pickup in productivity. Although the United States leads most other
Western economies in both the share of ICT in value added (Figure 5-16)
and TFP growth rates, some countries that lead the world in the former
exhibit low levels of the latter.
Access to the Internet not only enables firms to increase productivity,
but it also provides an opportunity for entrepreneurs to experiment with
innovative product ideas and new business models, and scale these ideas
and models up quickly and cheaply. For example, on-demand economy
platforms would not be possible but for the widespread adoption of Internet
and wireless devices (see Box 5-5 on On-Demand Economy). Not only do
these new business models help lower costs for consumers, leading to greater
consumer surplus, but also they may increase business productivity. For
example, a survey of San Francisco transportation-network company (TNC)
riders by University of California-Berkeley researchers found that TNC wait
times were dramatically shorter and more consistent than taxis (Rayle et
al. 2014). Shorter wait times mean that a worker is able to travel between
meetings or work and home quicker than before, raising the amount of
time a worker is able to spend being productive. As another example, entry

of online craft markets means that many craft artisans are able to increase
exposure in multiple markets, leading to increased scale and ultimately
productivity growth, much in the same way that higher exports from international trade leads to productivity growth. These business models also
introduce new competitive dynamics into established industries.

The Digital Divide Challenge
Broadband access has become a nearly indispensable component of
modern life, used for everything from engaging in personal communication, to searching for a job, and streaming online educational content to
engaging in civic affairs (National Telecommunications and Information
Administration and Economics and Statistics Administration 2013). Thus,
access to the Internet has become an essential resource for many nascent
entrepreneurs to reach potential customers. Customers who access the
Internet can benefit from the array of new products and services offered
by certain types of entrepreneurial new firms. However, a digital divide
(for example, the fact that certain groups of individuals and businesses lack
access to the Internet) means that some would-be entrepreneurs cannot
compete, and some would-be customers cannot access these new products
and services.

Box 5-5: The On-Demand Economy
“On-demand economy platforms” are online and mobile platforms
that match consumers to providers for the purpose of purchasing goods
or services on a “one-off” basis. This intentionally broad definition
includes the following types of platforms:
•	 Rental platforms most commonly involve homeowners renting
out their homes to business and vacation travelers. Other assets can also
be rented through similar arrangements, such as car and bicycle rentals.
•	 Craft platforms allow individuals and small businesses who
produce or collect craft-oriented goods to sell these goods to consumers.
•	 Financing platforms allow individuals and small firms to obtain
financing from lenders, in exchange for fixed payments, equity, or
rewards.
•	 “Gig” platforms allow individual providers to provide their labor
services, which might be tied to a specialized physical asset, such as a car
in the case of transportation-network companies (TNCs), or a specialized
human asset, such as the ability to code, to individual consumers and
small firms.
Because they are so nascent, relatively little economic research has
been done on these models. Moreover, many of these activities cannot be
isolated in official economic statistics and, in some cases, may in fact be
omitted from these statistics. At present, this portion of the economy still
appears relatively small—estimates suggest that it represents less than 1
percent of the working-age population and only accounts for a miniscule
portion of the economy as a whole; PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated
global revenues for the on-demand economy to be $15 billion in 2014
(PWC 2015). However, these business models are growing rapidly, and
McKinsey Global Institute predicts these business models will increase
global GDP by $2.7 trillion by 2025 (Manyika et al. 2015).
These platforms are already forcing incumbents to respond in
several industries—notably the taxi industry in which TNCs have
rapidly gained popularity and the lodging industry. For example, one
independent study found that entry of an online housing rental platform
led to lower hotel prices in Texas (Zervas, Proserpio, and Byers 2015). As
noted above on the dual role of startups, there do not need to be many
startups in an industry before the incumbents in that industry start to
undertake changes to guard against business losses. These actions could
take the form of innovative activity, which would boost both firm-level
and overall economic productivity, or dropping prices, which would
improve consumer welfare.
Medallion prices in New York City and Chicago have fallen
substantially since the introduction of TNCs, which is indicative of

242  |  Chapter 5

increased competition in the taxi market.1 Medallions in New York
City and Chicago are treated as private assets, and the total number of
medallions is limited by city government organizations—a practice that
effectively caps the quantity of rides available. Demand for rides in these
cities has previously exceeded the cap, so the medallion system works to
sustain city-determined, artificially-high fares, resulting in rents for taxi
medallion owners via this rationing process. Figure 5-iii below for New
York City shows that the average price for a single taxi medallion, which
had been increasing since 2010, started to fall in 2013. Similarly, the
number of taxi medallion transfers has dropped during this time. Figure
5-iv below for Chicago reveals similar trends in that prices started to fall
in 2013. By the end of 2015, the average transaction price for a medallion
in Chicago had fallen to $230,000, less than two-thirds of its value of two
years earlier. The number of medallions sold has also dropped during
this time.
Consumers appear to benefit from the on-demand economy
because of lower prices and a greater array of options, including proFigure 5-iii

vision of services that may not have previously existed or now reach
new geographic areas. While the evidence suggests that consumers
benefit from competition between on-demand economy platforms and
incumbent firms, the effect on wages and inequality is less certain. The
optimistic view is that this sector will be a source of productivity growth
that will increase consumer purchasing power across-the-board as well
as set an example of technological innovations complementing lowand mid-skilled workers, thus putting downward pressure on income
inequality. The pessimistic view is that, to the degree the on-demand
economy prospers because of regulatory arbitrage, it will not increase
productivity and could diminish social welfare. In this view, the firm that
is able to circumvent regulations that correct for a negative externality in
the marketplace (such as labor protection laws or safety regulations) will
lead market transaction volume to a quantity that is higher and a quality
that is lower than optimal. Moreover, dispersed employees will have a
hard time organizing for higher wages, so low- and mid-skilled workers
will be hurt, and certain features of the market could lead to high firm
concentration. Regardless of which view prevails, or which aspects of
both views, it remains important to balance innovative activities with
appropriate protections for workers and consumers.
An important feature of on-demand economy platforms is the
ratings and feedback mechanism that consumers use to rate providers,

and that providers use to rate consumers. Without these feedback
mechanisms, it would be very difficult for platform users to assess safety
and propensity for fraud, which are often governed by regulations in
traditional businesses that do not always extend to on-demand economy
firms. Ratings and feedback mechanisms do very little, however, to
promote basic labor standards for people performing the work, another
important purpose of regulation. These ratings mechanisms and other
user information collected by on-demand economy platforms also pose
privacy concerns that are not yet fully understood.

As of 2014, slightly more than three-quarters of American households
had adopted Internet in the home.11 Non-adopters cite cost, availability in
their communities, and perceived relevance as reasons to forego a broadband subscription.12 There is substantial variation in broadband access
across income groups. One way to visualize the digital divide is to consider
the relationship between Internet use and household income across different
areas of the entire United States. In Figure 5-17, each dot represents a single
Public Use Microdata Area, or PUMA, all of which are constructed by the
Census Bureau so that they contain roughly 100,000 residents.13 The graph
displays the share of residents in each PUMA who report using Internet in
the home against median household income for that PUMA.14
Figure 5-17 shows a strong positive relationship between home
Internet adoption and median income (Council of Economic Advisers
2015b). The wealthiest PUMAs tend to have home Internet adoption rates in
excess of 80 percent, while the least well off PUMAs have adoption rates of
50 percent or below. Admittedly, higher income might lead to more Internet
use, or vice versa, or there may be a third variable, such as education, that
11 These data come from Census’ 2014 American Community Survey. The relevant question is
worded such that the respondent is not asked to differentiate between wireline as opposed to
wireless access. Exact question text appears below in footnote 14.
12 Data on the reasons for non-adoption are from the Current Population Survey, as tabulated
by NTIA in its “Digital Nation” reports series.
13 PUMAs are geographic areas defined for statistical use. PUMAs are built using census tracts
and counties, nest within States, contain roughly 100,000 residents, and cover the entire United
States. For more information on Figure 5-17, as well as other statistics on the digital divide,
please see CEA’s 2015 issue brief “Mapping the Digital Divide”, available at: https://www.
whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/wh_digital_divide_issue_brief.pdf
14 The specific question used to calculate the share of households using the Internet was the
following, “At this house, apartment, or mobile home—do you or any member of this household
access the Internet?” Thus, CEA does not include householders that only access the Internet at
a public location, such as a school or library, in our measure of Internet adoption. Following the
convention that Census uses in its public reports on computer and internet use, group quarters
are excluded from these estimates, and a household is only counted as having internet access if
it reports having a subscription.

correlates with both outcomes. Keeping in mind these concerns about causal
inference, a linear regression suggests that doubling a PUMA’s median
household income is associated with a 20.2 percentage-point increase in the
expected rate of Internet adoption as of 2013 (Council of Economic Advisers
2015b).15 Moreover, the fact that nearly all Americans live in communities
where basic Internet service is available strongly suggests that income disparities play a dominant role in explaining this relationship. Thus, it does
not appear to be the case that telecommunications firms are systematically
choosing not to offer any form of Internet infrastructure in lower-income
communities. It should be acknowledged, however, that the quality of
Internet service available varies substantially, with more than one-half of
the population lacking access to download speeds of 25 Mbps or greater as
of 2013, often in rural or tribal areas (Council of Economic Advisers 2015b;
Beede 2014).
Closing this digital divide will allow more Americans to access the
opportunities afforded by the Internet, such as online job search and better educational opportunities (Stevenson 2008; Fairlie 2004). For example,
15 If home computer use is examined rather than home Internet use, the overall pattern is very
similar (although average computer adoption rates are higher (most so for the poorest 20 percent
of households), and regression estimates suggest that doubling median household income is
associated with a 19.3 percentage-point increase in the probability of having a computer at home.

246  |  Chapter 5

Kuhn and Mansour (2014) find that unemployed workers who search online
for work are re-employed 25 percent faster than comparable workers who
do not go online. More recent innovations, such as the on-demand economy
platforms, require workers to be connected to the Internet, either via mobile
or wireline, so as to sell their goods via a platform such as Etsy or Ebay, or
to sell their labor services via Taskrabbit, Lyft, or Uber. Thus, reducing the
digital divide not only enables more Americans to take advantage of Internet
for educational, health and other needs, it also enables more Americans to
access jobs and other employment opportunities.
To address these issues, the Administration has undertaken multiple
initiatives to make sure that all Americans can benefit from new technologies, a topic that was covered in detail in Chapter 5 of the 2014 Economic
Report of the President, and that has gained momentum in 2015. Since
2009, the public and private sectors have together invested more than $260
billion into new broadband infrastructure. Investments from the Federal
Government alone have led to the deployment or upgrading of over 110,000
miles of network infrastructure. At the same time, 45 million additional
Americans have adopted broadband. In January 2015, the President
announced concrete steps that the Administration would take to ensure
fast and reliable broadband is available to more Americans at the lowest
possible cost. Chief among these efforts is the promotion of communitybased broadband, which includes a call for State and local governments
to roll back short-sighted regulations that restrict competition. In March
2015, President Obama signed an Executive Memorandum creating the
Broadband Opportunity Council, an interagency group comprised of 25
Federal agencies and departments. The Council was tasked with promoting
broadband deployment, adoption, and competition. On September 21, 2015,
the White House released a report from the Council outlining steps that
agencies will take to make additional funds available for broadband deployment, eliminate barriers and promote broadband adoption. Also in 2015, the
Department of Commerce’s NTIA announced its Broadband USA initiative
focused on empowering communities to expand their broadband capacity
by providing technical assistance. And in July 2015, the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development unveiled Connect Home, a new initiative
involving communities, the private sector, and the Federal Government,
designed to expand high speed broadband to more families across the country. The pilot program launched in 27 cities and one tribal nation and will
initially reach over 275,000 low-income households, including 200,000 children. Finally, the President’s ConnectEd initiative is on track to connect 99
percent of American students to high-speed broadband in their classrooms
and libraries by 2018. Data show that the connectivity gap has been cut by
Technology and Innovation  |  247

about half since ConnectED was launched in 2013, with 20 million more students and 1.4 million more teachers now having access to fast broadband.16
Reducing the digital divide is critical: it ensures that all Americans can
benefit from new technologies and innovations; that more Americans find
jobs for which their skills are a good match; and that more Americans are
able to start new businesses and reach a larger customer base. Reducing the
digital divide therefore may be one way to address the long-term downward
trend in business dynamism and worker mobility. These new businesses in
turn compete with established firms, driving the cycle of competition and
innovation that is so vital to productivity growth.

Conclusion
Productivity growth is important for all Americans because it can lead
to higher wages and a higher standard of living. Technology and innovation
are key ingredients for productivity growth. New technologies and innovations help firms to produce products and services more efficiently, and also
lead to new products and services that are valued by consumers.
For these reasons, this Administration has made, and will continue
to make, increasing American productivity and innovation a top priority.
These initiatives take on a variety of forms, including patent reform efforts
to guarantee that the fruits of innovation go to their rightful recipients.
Additionally, spectrum policies have played a key role in promoting innovation, including spectrum sharing, the dedication of spectrum to foster safety
and mobility in next generation vehicles, incentive auctions, which re-allocate spectrum to its highest economic value use, and the Administration’s
pledge in 2010 to make available up to 500 MHz of Federal and non-Federal
spectrum over 10 years in order to enable licensed and unlicensed wireless
broadband technologies. Finally, international trade agreements like TPP
and T-TIP also promote the flow of ideas, increase access to markets, promote competition, and increase specialization in R&D. The Administration’s
entrepreneurship initiatives—such as “Startup in a Day”17 —are designed to
lower the barriers to starting and scaling a new company for all Americans.
Aspects of the Administration’s proposals for business tax reform would
reduce the effective tax on manufacturing to no more than 25 percent, at
the same time encouraging R&D and use of clean technologies. Similarly,
Chapter 6 in this Report covers in more detail how the Administration’s

infrastructure priorities would make sure that the supportive environment
for innovation is as complete as possible.
The Administration’s latest Strategy for American Innovation, released
in October 2015, details three key areas of investment that the government
can pursue to ensure that the United States retains its innovative edge in
the decades to come by: 1) continuing to invest in Federal R&D and other
building blocks for future private sector scientific and technological breakthroughs; 2) advancing Federal efforts in national priority areas like precision medicine and advanced manufacturing; and 3) improving the Federal
Government’s capacities for innovation.
Promoting productivity and innovation in the aggregate, however,
is not enough. Beyond closing the digital divide and improving education
in STEM, other policies such as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Earned
Income Tax Credit (EITC), and raising the minimum wage all have a role to
play as well. The ACA has the potential to allow prospective entrepreneurs
the flexibility to pursue creative ideas and found their own businesses, since
their health care insurance is no longer tied to their employment. The EITC
helps insure that low-wage workers are rewarded for their work, boosting
incomes of millions of American families, and allowing for more Americans
to share in rising prosperity. A higher minimum wage helps workers to
increase their share of the productivity growth. These and other policies
pursued by this Administration help insure that America will continue to
enjoy high productivity growth and that all Americans will share in the gains
from this growth.

THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS
OF INVESTING IN U.S.
INFRASTRUCTURE

T

ransportation infrastructure has been a key ingredient of economic
growth in this country. Ships and ports originally enabled the economic
development of the U.S. colonies by fostering the export of natural resources
and commodities and the import of manufactured products. Canals and
systems of dams and locks on major waterways first opened up the interior
of the country to global trade. Railways enabled the rapid expansion to the
West, providing an efficient and reliable cross-country option for moving
passengers and goods. Combined with the development of automobiles and
freight trucks, roads and highways—particularly the Interstate Highway
System—became the backbone of inter- and intra-state transportation,
offering households and businesses easily accessible and affordable transportation. Airplanes, especially in this modern era of globalization, have
fostered the expansion of international trade, the spread of new technology,
and the exchange of information, accounting for about a third of the value
of U.S. exports (U.S. Department of Transportation 2015a).
In each of these cases, investments in infrastructure not only contributed to increases in economic output, but also transformed the country. The
geographic and modal distribution of infrastructure more broadly affects
where people live and work, how we move goods from production to consumers, and how much carbon we emit. This chapter explores key aspects
of our Nation’s infrastructure: its current quality; the potential benefits of
infrastructure investment; why now is an opportune time to increase it;
the mechanisms through which transportation is typically funded; and the
Federal, State, and local roles that make all this possible.

251

Economic Principles for Infrastructure Policy
Infrastructure is defined as fixed capital assets that are consumed
jointly in various production processes that facilitate and support economic
activity, with “core” infrastructure referring to roads and other transportation facilities, power generation facilities and distribution networks, and
water and sewer systems. The services provided by infrastructure are an
indispensable input to the productive capacity of an economy, applied in
tandem with other key inputs such as labor, human capital, land, and natural
resources. Firms combine the use of infrastructure with these other inputs
to produce goods and services, while households employ infrastructure
services in both the production of output and the consumption of leisure
activities. Deficiencies in infrastructure have the potential to adversely
affect economic output, employment, and overall quality of life. At various
points in time, the country has recognized the need to substantially upgrade
its public infrastructure to foment economic development, and has subsequently invested in new and expanded infrastructure.
The crucial role of infrastructure is well recognized in economic
theory. Macroeconomics emphasizes the importance of infrastructure capital in fostering economic growth, while microeconomics notes the private
and social benefits that infrastructure services can provide for consumers,
businesses, and entire communities. Economic theory also highlights how,
to achieve optimal levels of investment, some forms of infrastructure may
require government involvement in their provision and financing because
they exhibit many characteristics of what economics defines as “public
goods.” Pure public goods have two unique characteristics: non-excludability in supply and non-rivalry in consumption. Non-excludability in supply
means that consumers cannot be prohibited from enjoying the benefits of
the public good; once the public good has been provided, the entity providing it cannot exclude members of the general public from utilizing its services (usually for technological reasons), and thus cannot charge anyone for
its use. Non-rivalry in consumption means that any one consumer’s decision
to use a good does not reduce the amount available for others. One cannot
keep a ship from seeing a lighthouse once it is lit (non-excludable), and one
ship seeing the lighthouse does not prevent others from seeing it (non-rival).
Since the services they provide are both non-excludable and non-rival
(for example, lighthouses and street lights), many types of transportation
infrastructure are classic examples of pure public goods. In other cases,
infrastructure may be excludable (a bridge with limited access) or rival
(overcrowded roads or bridges). Furthermore, highway and transit infrastructure often have spillovers beyond their immediate users, providing

252  |  Chapter 6

benefits to a wide set of consumers and firms—thus making it difficult to
identify who, and how much, to charge for those services. Other types of
infrastructure also have positive spillovers that are difficult to monetize,
such as public health benefits arising from improved clean water systems. As
a result, individual entities, both public and private, may overlook projects
that are not profitable for them, but nevertheless provide a net benefit for
society as a whole. Moreover, some types of infrastructure may be characterized by economies of scale; as such, only one firm can profitably provide the
service while competition with other firms would be inefficient. As a result,
the private sector may lack the proper incentives to invest in such capital or
may not provide the amount that is socially desirable, leading to market failure. These issues suggest that the government has a role to play in efficiently
supplying and maintaining transportation infrastructure, especially when it
spans across geographic borders.

Role of Government
The appropriate roles for different levels of government in planning
and funding infrastructure investments may vary. Historically, Federal
investments in infrastructure have been directed toward the formation of
new capital while State and local investments have been geared toward the
operation and maintenance of current infrastructure. There is a clear role
for Federal funding and financing for projects that benefit the country as a
whole. Still, many other arguments exist for a broader Federal role, including policy goals such as equity, safety, and enhanced access for all citizens,
as well as safeguarding the environment. The Nation recently took a first
step toward a sustained increase in Federal funding for infrastructure when
the President signed into law the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation
(FAST) Act of 2015, the first law enacted in more than 10 years that provides
guaranteed long-term funding for surface transportation. The FAST Act and
its impact on public infrastructure spending are discussed in detail later in
this chapter.
Private investment can also play an important role in the provision
of infrastructure through, for example, the formation of public-private
partnerships (PPPs), in which the government contracts out multiple stages
in the development process for new infrastructure to single private actors.
Through these partnerships, the private sector could be responsible for
some, if not all, of the stages in the life cycle of an infrastructure asset: design,
construction, financing, operation, and maintenance. Government involvement in PPPs and the potential benefits and drawbacks associated with these
partnerships are discussed later in the chapter. In any case, the potential to
attract private investment in specific circumstances does not diminish the

importance of a strong Federal role in planning and funding critical public
infrastructure.

The State of U.S. Infrastructure
Current Investment Levels
Over the past half-century, public spending on water and transportation infrastructure as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) has trended
slightly downward, as shown in Figure 6-1. Federal, State, and local government spending on water and transportation infrastructure accounted for
2.42 percent of GDP in 2014, 0.6 percentage point below its peak share of
GDP in 1959 and somewhat above the smallest annual share of GDP at 2.35
percent in 1998. Most of the public spending can be attributed to State and
local governments, which have accounted for, on average, about 72 percent
of public spending on water and transportation infrastructure since 1956.
The composition of public spending on water and transportation
infrastructure is now measurably different than it was in the late-1950s.
Mass transit and rail have acquired a markedly larger share of public
infrastructure funds. On average, from 1956 to 1960, streets and highways
accounted for just over 62 percent of public spending on water and transportation infrastructure, while mass transit and rail accounted for only about 5
percent. By the early 1980s, the former had fallen to just under 43 percent
while the latter had risen to over 15 percent. Since then, the distribution
of public funds on water and transportation infrastructure has been relatively unchanged: streets and highways (42 percent); water transportation,
resources, and utilities (35 percent); mass transit and rail (14 percent); and
aviation (9 percent).
In the United States, public gross investment in new capital formation
as a share of GDP, which includes core infrastructure as well as other types
of capital such as equipment, intellectual property products, and Federal
defense spending, has been declining over the past half-century. Public gross
fixed investment is emphasized, as opposed to a more narrowly defined,
infrastructure-specific category, because it allows for a comprehensive comparison of public investment across most of the G-7 for the past 35 years. As
shown in Figure 6-2, this downward trend in new capital investment is not
unique to the United States. Other members of the G-7—including Japan,
France, and Germany—have experienced similar declines in their respective
shares of GDP accounted for by public investment in new capital in recent
decades. From 2011 through 2015, U.S. public capital investment as a share
of GDP averaged 3.7 percent, its lowest trailing five-year average since 1950.

Transportation Infrastructure Quality
The aging of U.S. transportation infrastructure has been widely
recognized. The Urban Land Institute (2011) noted that road systems and
water-treatment plants built with Federal grants over 40 to 50 years ago
are now reaching the end of their life cycles. According to the Bureau of
Economic Analysis (BEA), the average age of the net stock for different
public core infrastructure assets has steadily increased over the past halfcentury, as shown in Figure 6-3.1 In 2014, the average age of public streets
and highways, water supply facilities, sewer systems, power facilities, and
transportation assets reached historic highs. Though this result is not that
surprising—given that in-place capital is constantly aging—what is striking
is the rapidity with which their average ages have risen of late. From 2010 to
2014, the average age of streets and highways increased 3.2 years, the greatest
four-year change on record and more than the 2.9-year increase over the two
decades prior. Water supply facilities aged on average 1.2 years from 2010
to 2014, above the 0.7-year increase over the 20 years prior. Public sewer
systems and power facilities aged slightly less from 2010 to 2014 than they
1 The average age is calculated as the weighted average of the ages of all depreciated investment
in the stock at the end of the year, with the weight for each age based on its value in the total
net stock. Consequently, an asset with a net stock consisting of a high proportion of older
investment will have a high average age. Average ages are based on current, or inflationadjusted, asset costs.

increased nearly 20 percent over the decade ended 2014.
The declining quality of U.S. transportation infrastructure is also seen
in global measures. The World Economic Forum releases annual ratings that
gauge the quality of infrastructure throughout the world, and its ratings for
the United States are displayed in Figure 6-4. These ratings are determined
on a 1-7 scale, with a higher score indicating a better quality level. In 2015,
the United States received a rating of 5.8 for its overall infrastructure, which
was above the 5.4-average rating across the world’s advanced economies,
the 3.8-average across emerging and developing Asian nations, and the 4.1
global average. However, the overall U.S. rating for infrastructure in 2015
was noticeably below its level in the mid-2000s, falling nearly 8 percent
since 2006. In comparison, the overall infrastructure rating for the world’s
advanced economies increased about 2 percent over the same period.
Ratings for U.S. air transportation, ports, and roads are also lower today
than they were in the mid-2000s. Ratings for railroads have been historically
well below that of all U.S. infrastructure and of other transportation categories. Although some recent improvements have been observed, the quality
of both U.S. infrastructure overall and various transportation subcategories
remain either substandard or low relative to historical levels.
This trend of declining infrastructure quality is not uncommon
among the G-7 countries, as seen in Table 6-1. The quality of overall

infrastructure in 2015 for G-7 nations, with the exception of Japan and Italy,
was lower than it was in the mid-2000s, declines comparable in magnitude
to that observed in the United States. In regards to specific transportation
infrastructure, the United States’ performance in 2015 relative to the rest of
the G-7 was mixed: The United States had the highest rating for air transportation and, along with the United Kingdom, ranked highest for ports, but
ranked behind France and Japan for roads and was below the G-7 average
for railroads.
Many U.S. roadways and bridges, in particular, are in poor condition. According to the International Roughness Index—a measure of the
condition of road and highway surfaces—nearly 21 percent of U.S. roadways
provided a substandard ride quality in 2013, the largest share from 1999 to
2013 (U.S. DOT 2015c).2 In 2014, the number of bridges that were rated
as structurally deficient was just above 61,000, while the number that were
rated as functionally obsolete, or inadequate for performing the tasks for
which the structures were originally designed, was slightly below 85,000
(DOT 2015d). The number of structurally deficient bridges has declined on
average 2.7 percent a year since 2000, below the 4.2-percent average annual
rate of decline throughout the 1990s. The number of functionally obsolete
bridges has also declined steadily since 2000, falling on average about 0.5
percent a year. Combined, these two groups accounted for just below 24
percent of all bridges in 2014, the smallest annual percentage on record.
More investment is needed to resolve these deficiencies. The U.S.
Federal Highway Administration estimates that noticeably improving
roadway conditions and performance—rather than allowing congestion to
increase further and pavement conditions to worsen—would require a capital investment in roads across all levels of government of $124 to $146 billion
annually, with larger estimates corresponding to higher forecasts for the rate
of growth in motor vehicle travel (DOT 2013). A growing population and
economy will only serve to exacerbate these deficiencies. As the number of
users who depend on transportation infrastructure increases, so too will the
stress that is placed on these structures—leading to augmented congestion
and necessary maintenance. Under higher expected growth rates for motor
vehicle travel, roughly half (54 percent) of the aforementioned investment
would be used for improving the physical conditions of current road infrastructure. The timeliness of such investment and the mechanisms through
which it could occur are explored later in this chapter.

2 A substandard quality of ride is defined as having an International Roughness Index value
greater than 170. Data for 2010 and comparable data prior to 1999 are unavailable.

Congestion
Individuals experience the costs of insufficient road and bridge infrastructure capacity partly through increased congestion, which will continue
to rise as the number of cars driving on roads increases. Table 6-2 characterizes the evolution of U.S. roadway congestion over the past three decades.
Commuter delays translate into economic costs through lost time that could
be spent at work or consuming leisure activities, as well as through wasted
fuel consumed by vehicles in congested traffic. In 1990, the average commuter was delayed a total of 26 hours over the course of the year, leading
to an aggregate delay of 3 billion hours for all travelers collectively, a waste
of 1.2 billion gallons of fuel, and an estimated total cost of $65 billion. Since
then, a near 62-percent increase in the average commuter’s annual delay,
coupled with an estimated 42-percent rise in the total amount of commuters, has led to aggregate hours delayed, fuel wasted, and total cost more
than doubling from their 1990 levels. Through the rest of the decade, these
congestion measures are expected to continue increasing.
Higher levels of congestion also lead to increased carbon dioxide
emissions: Congestion mitigation strategies that smooth traffic flows could
reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 7 to 12 percent based on typical
conditions on Southern California freeways (Barth and Boriboonsomsin
2008). Clean energy transportation investments, discussed in Box 6-1, can
lessen the impact congestion has on the environment. Increased congestion
has also been associated with reduced employment growth: a 10-percent
increase in congestion for a city with relatively high congestion levels could
reduce long-run employment growth by as much as 4 percent (Hymel 2009).
Investing in infrastructure will help alleviate congestion both in the short

run, by providing increased road capacity and easing bottlenecks to allow
more fluid transportation, as well as in the long run, by providing enhanced
travel options that can help divert traffic away from frequently congested
roadways and bridges.
More time spent commuting can also produce individual behavioral
and socioeconomic costs. Transportation congestion induces more stressful
commutes, which Navaco and Gonzalez (2011) note has been shown to be
associated with “negative mood on arrival at work, negative mood at home
in the evening, lowered frustration tolerance, cognitive performance impairments, illness, work absences, job instability, lowered residential satisfaction,
and lowered overall life satisfaction.” Thus, elevated stress from worsening
commuting conditions may put downward pressure on workplace productivity as well as overall worker sentiment. Moreover, increased time spent
commuting implies that less time can be spent on health-related activities
such as sleep and exercise. As Christian (2012) notes, longer commutes are
linked to “behavioral patterns which over time may contribute to obesity
and other poor health outcomes.”

Benefits of Investing in Infrastructure
This section discusses the role of infrastructure in the economy,
highlighting the channels through which infrastructure investment can
spur overall economic activity in both the short and long run. In the near
term, this boost occurs through the demand-side of the economy. Because
investing in infrastructure requires raw materials, manufactured goods, and
extensive labor, it stimulates economic activity among firms in the supply
chain and in households with members searching for employment. In the
260  |  Chapter 6

Box 6-1: Clean Energy and Transportation Infrastructure
Infrastructure investments can have wide-ranging impacts on
patterns of development in a city, the number of cars accessing certain
areas, and ultimately environmental outcomes. A sound infrastructure
plan takes into account environmental impacts and can help achieve
both development and climate improvement goals. Such a plan can
accommodate economic growth, encourage new, greener fuels in transportation networks, support public transit, encourage more thoughtful
land-use planning, and reduce congestion and pollution from idling.
When deciding on a new infrastructure proposal, it is important for
Federal, State, and local governments to consider the overall social
impact that the proposal will have. This includes not just the financial
costs incurred and potential revenues raised, but also indirect benefits
such as improved environmental conditions, better health from reduced
air pollution, and decreased city congestion—all of which can be more
difficult to monetize.
Public transit can often provide an effective way to achieve transportation goals while safeguarding the environment, and recent innovations in green transit have served to amplify these benefits. Finishing
a process that began in 1995, Los Angeles County Metropolitan
Transportation Authority became the first major U.S. transit agency to
replace all diesel buses in its extensive Metro fleet with newer versions
that operate instead on clean, alternative energy (Weikel 2011). The transition is estimated to have reduced the emission of greenhouse gases by
roughly 300,000 pounds a day, and cancer-causing particulates from the
city’s buses by 80 percent. Also in California, an 800-mile high-speed rail
system—the Nation’s first—is in the process of being built and expected
to begin operation in 2029 (California High-Speed Rail Authority 2015).
By 2040, the new rail system is predicted to decrease the total distance
vehicles travel each day by almost 10 million miles and reduce the number of daily flights by roughly 100 or more. This immense project will be
funded partly by a state voter-approved $9.95 billion bond measure, and
partly by funds made available through the Federal Government.
The push toward clean automobile fuel is also well underway.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 dedicated $17.7
billion to energy-efficient transportation: implementing tax credits for
businesses that installed alternative fuel pumps, funding the development of advanced vehicle batteries, and subsidizing the reduction of
diesel emissions (National Resources Defense Council 2009). These
investments helped to catalyze and accelerate the development of clean
energy technologies that have begun to have broad impacts on energy
industries. Higher fuel efficiency standards have also pushed auto manu-

facturers toward cleaner low-emissions vehicles. In 2015, through the
Biofuel Infrastructure Partnership, the Federal Government agreed to
match funds provided by states and private partners for pumps that supply renewable fuels to motorists (U.S. Department of Agriculture 2015).
More than 20 states have enrolled in the program, applying for over $130
million of funding—$30 million more than anticipated.
Transportation infrastructure investment can help address congestion and the subsequent pollution it produces. For example, the
Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program provides
funding to State and local governments for projects that will help meet
requirements set by the Clean Air Act. Projects eligible for financing
through this program include ones aimed toward expanding accessibility to public transit, reducing harmful emissions, and ameliorating
traffic congestion. Included in the President’s fiscal year 2017 budget
is an initiative to increase Federal funding toward clean transportation
infrastructure, a proposal that is discussed in detail in Box 6-4.

medium and long term, benefits materialize primarily on the supply-side.
Higher-capacity and better-performing infrastructure supports faster, more
reliable transport flows. As a result, households can increase their consumption through reduced travel costs and firms can exploit economies of scale
in their production processes and distribution networks. Investing in new
infrastructure also increases the flow of capital services that households
and firms can utilize to produce valuable commodities and services. These
longer-term supply improvements enable the economy to use private capital, labor, energy, and other inputs more productively, thereby augmenting
the economy’s future potential growth.

Short-Term, Demand-Side Benefits
Slack in the economy refers to the underutilization of resources like
labor and capital. When slack exists in the economy, fiscal spending can help
alleviate that slack by augmenting its contribution to public works projects.
In the near term, public investment can reduce unemployment, provide
workers with disposable income, and spur economic activity through the
purchasing of inputs needed for implementing these projects (see Table 6-3).
Government spending has a multiplier effect, which is defined as the dollar
change in output caused by a $1 change in public spending. The multiplier
measures the effects of government spending on overall economic activity
rather than simply the impacts on businesses or households that directly
receive the spending.

The short-run public investment multiplier for economic output has
been well-documented. The International Monetary Fund (2014) finds,
during times of low growth, a public spending multiplier of 1.5 in the same
year as the investment and a slightly higher multiplier of 3 over the next four
years. When a government has clearly identified infrastructure needs, an efficient investment process for identifying and directing funding toward those
needs, and economic slack, then there is a strong case for increasing public
investment in infrastructure. With nominal interest rates at or close to zero
percent, the effects of increased government spending can be larger than
they would be during normal circumstances when interest rates are higher.
When the Central Bank’s policy rate is set at zero—which it was from 2009
through 2015—Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Rebelo (2011) and Eggerston
(2011) find stronger effects of increased public investment, producing shortrun multipliers that range between 2 and 2.5. Because of its labor-intensive
nature, spending on transportation is associated with even larger boosts to
economic output than other government spending, with a short-run multiplier of about 2.7 (Leduc and Wilson 2014). In addition, to the degree that

The Economic Benefits of Investing in U.S. Infrastructure | 263

sustained losses in economic output lead discouraged workers to drop out
of the labor force for prolonged periods and make them reluctant to return,
alleviating these output losses in the short run can help to increase long-run
output. When there is less slack in the economy, or when the Central Bank
might tighten monetary policy in response to fiscal spending, fiscal multipliers are much lower (Auerbach and Gorodnichenko 2012).
As shown in Table 6-3, these short-run multipliers are in line with
those calculated using the Benchmark Input-Output Accounts from 2007
released by the BEA.3 The input-output calculations highlight the indirect
effects that increased spending in a given industry can have on the rest of
the economy. Each additional dollar spent toward infrastructure—whether
it is through the Federal or State and local governments; used for highways
and streets, electricity, or water and sewage; or devoted to the formation of
new capital or the maintenance of current infrastructure—has a multiplier
notably larger than 1. The largest multiplier stems from State and local
government spending on passenger transit at 3.19, indicating that such
an investment leads to more than triple its value in economic output. The
indirect multipliers from investing in infrastructure can be especially large
for the manufacturing sector (for example, 0.88 for State and local government investment in passenger transit and 0.48 for highways and streets
more generally). Positive impacts on the manufacturing sector likely result
because constructing, operating, and maintaining public infrastructure
relies heavily on manufactured goods. There are also substantial spillovers to
non-manufacturing industries, which, being the largest part of the economy,
are affected by a general increase in economic activity.
Even as labor markets normalize, increased infrastructure investment
would provide, at the very least, short-run boosts to output and jobs. CEA
(2014) finds that 68 percent of the jobs created from infrastructure investment would stem from construction. According to the Quarterly Census
of Employment and Wages, the average weekly wage for private construction employment in 2014 was $1,058, 7-percent higher than the privatesector average. Thus, most of the employment generated from investing
in infrastructure would be well-paying, middle-class jobs. Although the
boosts to output and employment are larger when the increase in public
spending occurs during a period of greater economic slack, there is still a
benefit to increasing government spending on infrastructure today. Beyond
the short-term boosts to demand for labor and other resources, however,

latest year for which the BEA released a more comprehensive breakdown of the industry-byindustry input-output data, providing the cross-section between 389 industries and allowing
for the analysis of more disaggregated investment categories such as those displayed in Table

infrastructure investment is crucial for supporting long-term growth by
providing the necessary supply-side inputs.

Long-Term, Supply-Side Benefits
Well-targeted infrastructure investments increase the economy’s
long-run growth potential. Macroeconomists have closely examined the
link between infrastructure investment and economic development, finding
that infrastructure boosts productivity and offers large socioeconomic gains.
Public investment in infrastructure propels future productivity growth
through several channels: enabling firms to take advantage of economies of
scale and increase production through reduced input costs; lowering transport, storage and vehicle maintenance costs for households and firms by easing congestion and improving the quality of roads and highways; increasing
the productivity of private capital through improved resource utilization;
and increasing workers’ access to labor market opportunities, thus facilitating more efficient hiring matches. These effects are especially relevant today
as the United States continues to experience lagging productivity growth
(see discussion in Chapter 2 and Figure 2-30).
Increasing public infrastructure investment supports growth in
labor productivity by augmenting growth in total factor productivity and
by increasing the capital intensity of production throughout the economy.
Boosting the capital intensity of production occurs both directly, by increasing the accumulated stock of public capital, and indirectly because a larger
stock of public infrastructure fosters increased private capital investment.
By increasing private-sector output and improving the productivity of
private capital, infrastructure spending can induce greater private spending
by increasing the returns to investment on private capital.4 Larger stocks
of public capital, and the flow of services they generate, raise the marginal
productivity of other inputs to production, including private capital and
labor. Because more efficient input use leads to lower costs of production,
businesses will expand their production capacity to take advantage of these
cost reductions. Through this mechanism, increasing the stock of public
capital investment can effectively augment the level of private investment.
Some research found that increasing aggregate public investment
by $1 can increase long-term private investment by $0.64 (Pereira 2001).
However, this effect was found to vary noticeably among different types of
infrastructure: Pereira (2001) estimated that publicly investing $1 in electric
and gas facilities, transit systems, and airfields induces a $2.38 rise in longterm private investment, whereas an additional $1 of public investment in
4 See Nadiri and Mamuneas (1996) for an analysis of this mechanism through the highway
capital stock.

The Economic Benefits of Investing in U.S. Infrastructure | 265

highways and streets increases private capital investment by only $0.11.
Although the effects are more muted for some types of infrastructure, public
investment in each amplifies private investment in the long-term. By enticing greater long-run private capital investment, increased public spending
spurs capital deepening and, in turn, raises future productivity and thus
long-run potential economic growth.
Many studies have assessed the productivity effects of public capital
investment for the United States, Organization for Economic Co-operation
and Development member nations, and developing countries. The variability and potential biases associated with these estimates are discussed in Box
6-2. A literature review of economic analyses from 1983 to 2008 suggests
that on average, a 1-percent increase in public capital leads to a 0.11-percent
rise in output (Bom and Ligthart 2014). In 2014, the stock of physical public
capital relative to GDP was about 76 percent. Given this elasticity estimate
and the size of the public capital stock, the marginal product of public capital
is about 14 percent. Thus, given the deficiency in infrastructure described
above, a $1 increase in the total value of the public capital stock would raise
annual economic output by about $0.14.

Infrastructure’s Direct Boost to Productivity
Beyond the ways in which infrastructure boosts economic activity
and productivity through spillovers, it also raises productivity directly by
increasing capital services used by industry. For example, publically funded
highways and airports provide capital services through the transportation of
goods that are sold in the private sector. Real capital services from the public
capital stock are a flow that is calculated as the sum of the real interest payments on and the depreciation of the capital stock. This definition roughly
parallels that used in the calculation of the contribution of private capital to
labor productivity growth. A business or government purchases a structure
or piece of equipment when the expected present value of the future flow
of services from that structure or equipment meets or exceeds the original
price. As the capital stock is used and ages, it loses its value (depreciation)
in rough proportion to the services that it renders. Interest payments on the
funds borrowed to finance the purchase should be added to this flow.
The growth rate of public capital services per private-sector employeehour and its contribution to nonfarm productivity growth are shown in
Table 6-4. Growth of capital services per hour fell from an annual rate of
growth of 2.6 percent during the 1947-to-1973 period to only 0.7 percent
a year during the 1973-to-1995 period. To derive the direct contribution
to nonfarm productivity growth, the growth of public capital services is

266  |  Chapter 6

Box 6-2: Elasticity of Output to Public Capital
Attempts to gauge the contribution of the public capital stock
to economic output have focused on calculating the output elasticity
of public capital, or the percent change in output that results from a
1-percent increase in public capital.1 Aschauer (1989) was among the
first to estimate the magnitude of this effect for the United States, finding
an output elasticity of public capital of 0.39—implying that U.S. public
capital investment has been an important factor in influencing historical growth in U.S. economic output. Since that time, an abundance of
research has been devoted to gauging the elasticity of a nation’s output
to its public capital stock, though no consensus has surfaced, as shown in
Figure 6-i. While most of the estimates summarized in the Figure cluster
near 0.1, they have ranged from as low as -0.14 to as high as 1.14. The
following discussion explores the reasons for the wide disparity in the
estimates summarized in Figure 6-i.
One reason for the wide variation is that empirical estimates may
vary depending upon the time horizon over which the output elasticity is
calculated. Looking over the near term is likely to produce lower output

1 This calculation is different than the spending multipliers mentioned earlier. These
measures look at annual changes in economic activity, including the infrastructure spending
itself, relative to spending in a given year. The output elasticity of public capital considers
the impact from the public capital stock on other economic activity.

The Economic Benefits of Investing in U.S. Infrastructure | 267

elasticities since short-run analyses ignore the long-term nature of public
capital’s effects on private investment, productivity, and economic
growth. New infrastructure may not only take years to complete, but may
require years before its productivity boost to society is realized. When
evaluated over the long run, the output elasticity of public capital has
been found to be on average nearly 0.04 percentage point higher than
those calculated over the near term (Melo, Graham, and Brage-Ardao
2013; Bom and Ligthart 2014).
Second, the level of aggregation at which the analysis is conducted
can heavily influence the output elasticity calculated. Given its far-reaching nature, the formation of new public capital can augment production
capacity, not only in the areas in which structures are built, but in neighboring economies as well. Consequently, analyses that focus on regional
data will inherently overlook spillover effects into nearby areas, whereas
those that use national data will naturally internalize these effects in their
empirical estimates. Not accounting for these spillover impacts can put
sizable downward pressure on output elasticity estimates, resulting in
values that are more than 0.15 percentage point less than their nationaldata counterparts (Bom and Ligthart 2014).
Third, analyses that use a production function estimated from
historical data on investment and output may spuriously overstate the
output elasticity of public capital. Some exercises may find relatively
large output elasticities because they fail to account for common trends
in the data. Given that time series for output and public capital tend to
exhibit common stochastic trends, estimates produced from econometric analyses of their historical levels may produce artificially high results.
Time-series analyses that fail to test for common time trends among the
variables they employ often find output elasticities of public capital that
are 0.1 percentage point on average higher than those that conduct such
tests and employ estimation procedures that account for these trends
(Bom and Ligthart 2014).
Fourth, to account for the spurious results that can arise from
using historical levels of investment and output, many studies have
constructed estimates that instead rely on year-over-year changes in
these variables. Although this avoids the potential aforementioned bias
from using the historical levels of data series, this approach is likely to
understate the actual output elasticity, and can produce estimates that
appear to be zero, though the true effect may be positive (Hurlin and
Minea 2012). One problem with this method is that it assumes that the
impact of public capital investment on output occurs instantaneously,
rather than requiring a prolonged period for the effects to be felt. Because
analyses that rely exclusively on year-over-year changes in investment

268  |  Chapter 6

and output ignore potential inter-temporal long-run relationships that
may exist among these variables, their results may underestimate the
impact that investments in public capital have on output.
Last, studies that try to measure an output elasticity of public capital
may suffer from reverse causality (or endogeneity issues), meaning that
changes in economic output influence infrastructure investment and the
stock of public capital, rather than the reverse. For example, higher levels
of output may increase the demand for public capital or support more
favorable fiscal conditions for elevating government investment. In this
case, the elasticity of output to public capital may be overstated since
favorable business-cycle conditions are artificially strengthening this
estimated relationship. Similarly, increasing public investment may be
used as a countercyclical measure to spur economic activity when output
is depressed. As a result, though the size of the public capital stock may
increase, economic output may remain temporarily suppressed, leading
to underestimates of the relevant output elasticities. Using econometric
techniques that account for potential reverse causality typically lowers
the estimated elasticity of output to public capital by about 0.05 percentage point (Bom and Ligthart 2014).
When incorporating the output elasticity of public capital in an
economic analysis, it is important to note the time-horizon and the
geographic scope of government that is being used. Although Bom and
Ligthart (2014) find an average elasticity of output to public capital of
about 0.11 percentage point—notably below that reported by Aschauer
(1989)—they note that the elasticity of output is heterogeneous across
these dimensions. As one illustration, they find that the long-run output
elasticity for State and local government spending on core infrastructure
is more than twice as large as the short-run output elasticity for Federal
spending on total infrastructure.

weighted by its “share” in output.5 The slowdown in capital services per hour
played a small role in causing the post-1973 slowdown in labor productivity
growth, with its contribution dropping 0.08 percentage point between the
two periods (from 0.18 percentage point a year to 0.10 percentage point a
year). Of course, the indirect effects of lower public investment could also
have played an important role.
The growth rate of public capital services per employee-hour remained
low at only 1.1 percent a year during the 1995-to-2007 period. The growth
rate picked up to 2.1 percent a year during the 2007-to-2014 period, a

the definition of nonfarm output has been rescaled so as to include the implicit contribution of
public capital.

pickup that is fully accounted for by a dramatic slowing of employee-hours
growth (from 1.0 percent a year to –0.2 percent a year) rather than a pickup
in capital services growth (which was about 2.0 percent a year in both the
1995-to-2007 and the 2007-to-2014 periods). Public capital services per
employee-hour (which accelerated in the 2007-to-2014 period) does not
account for the recent slowdown in productivity growth as it did during the
slowdown from the 1947-to-1973 period to the 1973-to-1995 period. That
said, faster growth of public capital might have boosted recent productivity
growth if suitable capital projects could have been found. Additional public
capital investment might also have supported aggregate demand if it was
appropriately timed.

Infrastructure Investment and Agglomeration
As workers and firms gather in the same location, the costs of transporting goods and hiring employees decline, leading to lower production
costs for firms. An advantageous location or access to natural resources
initially attracts businesses and households to a site, and as the surrounding
region develops, the costs of doing business there decline and the existence
of a thriving business community attracts other firms and consumers. These
cost advantages stem from the spatial concentration of firms and workers,
and are called agglomeration economies. Investing in high-capacity transportation facilities (such as mass transit) often fosters such agglomeration
effects by enabling less-dense areas to urbanize, improving access throughout an urbanized area and reducing the costs associated with transportation.

270  |  Chapter 6

Thus, ideas are exchanged, workers with specific skills are available, and
supply systems can flourish. The benefits of reduced travel costs and more
free-flowing, universal access redouble throughout the region. Workers can
find jobs that take full advantage of their specialized skills, enabling firms
to operate more efficiently and thus spurring other firms and workers in
the economy to produce more efficiently. As a result, agglomeration effects
can accentuate the impact that infrastructure investment normally has on
productivity growth.

Spillover Effects
While investing in infrastructure generates direct benefits in the form
of increased employment and higher productivity—benefits that may be
magnified through agglomeration effects—it can also offer spillover benefits
for neighboring economies. Road and highway infrastructure in particular
has led to marked spillover effects (see Box 6-3, which highlights the spillover effects that stemmed from the formation of the Interstate Highway
System). Output in the agricultural sector in particular has benefited
through spatial spillovers from road investments. One study finds that a
1-percent increase in outlays on roads in a state is associated with a roughly
0.03-percent expansion in agricultural output in that state, and an average
increase of 0.24 percent in adjacent states and their neighbors (Tong et al.
2013). The magnitude and structure of the spillover effects vary based on
the location of the state and the paths available for the spillover effect. These
effects are especially pronounced in the agriculturally concentrated central
United States relative to less agriculturally intensive regions.
Improvements in airport infrastructure offer both direct and spillover
gains, which can be geographically extensive because of the network nature
of air service; that is, improving an airport in one location results in faster
and more reliable connections with many other areas. Investments in air
transportation can effectively reduce travel time and promote more reliable
flights, enhancing worker productivity and shipping efficiency. Directly, a
10-percent increase in passenger enplanements in a metro area has been
found to raise employment in service industries—which account for almost
84 percent of total private employment—by about 1 percent (Brueckner
2003). Indirectly, the expansion of airport infrastructure has been associated
with cost savings in manufacturing production not only in states in which
the airports are located, but in other states as well. A 1-percent increase in
state airport infrastructure stock—defined as airport capital expenditures
for construction, land, structure, and equipment—has been found to correspond to a decrease in manufacturing costs of about 0.1 percent within
that state and between 0.1 and 0.2 percent within other states, with higher

Box 6-3: The Interstate Highway System
What has been called the “greatest public works project in history,”
the Interstate Highway System remains one of the largest investments
in infrastructure by the U.S. Government (DOT 2015e). President
Dwight D. Eisenhower recognized the social and economic importance of constructing a highway system in his 1956 State of the Union
Address, highlighting that it was needed for “the personal safety, the
general prosperity, the national security of the American people” (Public
Broadcasting Service 1956). The 47,000-mile highway system, spanning
all 48 contiguous states, was a project commissioned by the Federal Aid
Highway Act of 1956.
The project pushed public spending on highways to historic highs
in the late-1950s and throughout the 1960s. From 1956 to 1970, public
spending on highways averaged about 1.7 percent of GDP and accounted
for roughly 60 percent of public spending on water and transportation
infrastructure (Congressional Budget Office 2015). Highways remain
a major part of infrastructure investment. From 2000 to 2014, public
spending on highways averaged just above 1 percent of GDP and represented about 41 percent of public spending on water and transportation
infrastructure. From increased trade and job growth to more free-flowing
and accessible transportation, the construction of the Interstate Highway
System demonstrates the potential gains that large-scale infrastructure
projects can offer and remains a powerful example of our past investment in infrastructure development.
When drivers switch from a traditional road to a wider, straighter
interstate highway, travel costs are substantially reduced. Savings are estimated at $0.19 a mile for automobiles and $0.38 a mile for trucks, stemming from reduced travel time, accidents, and vehicle operating costs
(Thompson and Chandra 1998). This effect, combined with decreased
travel distance between cities, has been shown to have a positive impact
on trade by, for example, allowing for the transportation of heavier goods
(Duranton, Morrow, and Turner 2014). Rural counties that became
connected by the Interstate Highway System experienced as much as
a 10-percentage point increase in trade-related activities per capita
(Michaels 2008). Moreover, a 1-percent increase in the highway capital
stock per capita in a given northeast metropolitan area—measured using
Federal, State, and local government expenditures on highways—was
found to be associated with a 0.05-percent rise in annual economic output per capita both in that region and in its nearest neighbor (Chen and
Haynes 2015). Beyond the gains from trade, investing in highways has
been found to have boosted employment as well: a 10-percent increase in
a metropolitan statistical area’s stock of interstate highways (measured as

272  |  Chapter 6

kilometers of road) in 1983 resulted in 1.5 percent more employment for
that area 20 years later (Duranton and Turner 2012).
From decreased travel costs and increased trade to higher employment and output, the economic effects of a national highway system are
clear. The Interstate Highway System provides an interconnectedness
that was not there before, a means by which individuals and goods could
travel more fluidly throughout the contiguous United States. The effects
from the Interstate Highway System were drastic at its implementation,
and continue to be substantial today.

spillover effects stemming from states without large hubs (Cohen and
Morrison Paul 2003).6
Both investment in new public capital and improved maintenance of
existing infrastructure can produce spillover effects, again presumably due
to the network nature of most transportation infrastructure, where expanding a single facility can improve connections among many origins and
destinations. In fact, there is some evidence that the effects from State and
local government investment in public capital can be larger for neighboring states than for the ones in which the investments are made. Evaluating
annual state-level output and constructing weighted spillover indexes
based on the commodity flows across states and the relative magnitudes of
neighboring economies, Kalyvitis and Vella (2015) find that outlays for new
capital as well as those for operation and maintenance have large positive
effects on neighboring economies, calculating average spillover elasticities of output from new public capital and maintenance of 0.09 and 0.34,
respectively. The relatively large spillover effects from public spending on
operation and maintenance may result because states and localities primarily fund operation and maintenance; as such, only the states and localities
that make the investments incur the associated costs, allowing other states
to enjoy the benefits without paying for the investment. Yet these authors’
estimates for direct output elasticities of public capital for states in which
the investments are made are noticeably smaller at near-zero values. This
divergence in magnitude between direct and spillover effects from public
infrastructure spending on output is one reason why Federal support and
trans-state organizations such as the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey are important.
A failure to recognize these spillover effects from the construction
and improvement of transportation networks by State and local government

enplanements of passengers.

agencies responsible for funding public infrastructure may cause those agencies to undervalue the true social gains that such projects offer.

Household Effects
New investments in public transportation infrastructure, especially in
expanded transit service, also support more robust and mobile labor markets
by reducing geographic mismatches between the skill demands of jobs and
workers who can offer specialized skills, and by providing potentially faster
and less-costly transportation options to connect workers with jobs. Public
infrastructure can directly influence where people choose to live and work
since access to public transit can play a crucial role in this decision-making
process, especially for households who cannot afford or choose not to own
cars. New public transit services can improve labor market efficiency by
connecting individuals with jobs to which they may not previously have
had access. Kawabata (2003) found that improved access to jobs through
public transit noticeably increased the probability that low-skilled workers
without automobiles in San Francisco and Los Angeles would be employed,
and also increased the likelihood that such employment would be full-time.
Another study found that more extensive metropolitan-area public transit
infrastructure increases the employment density of central cities by 19
percent, and that a 10-percent rise in bus or rail service per capita increases
metropolitan-area wages by, on average, $45 million annually (Chatman and
Noland 2014).
Improving public infrastructure can also foster higher city and suburban property values. Possible channels through which this effect can occur
include: positive urban employment and spending spillovers from suburban
inflows; the positive impact that high-quality infrastructure has on the perception of a metropolitan area; and the spillover of productivity gains from
city centers to their surrounding suburbs. Haughwout (1999) found that a $1
billion increase in spending on city infrastructure would raise city property
values by $590 million and related suburban property values by $540 million.
This result provides a rationale for potential Federal or State involvement in
the provision of urban public infrastructure, particularly where large urban
regions cross state borders, and where sharing of common administrative
overhead across a multi-jurisdictional project leads to more cost-efficient
project delivery than undertaking multiple separate projects.

Prospects for Increased
Infrastructure Investment
Low Interest Rates
Investment in America’s infrastructure is arguably as important today
as it has been at any point in recent history given its current state of deterioration. The financial environment faced by all levels of government provides
even further justification. Yields on 20-year U.S. Treasury bonds as well as
on State and local bonds are at near-historic lows, meaning that government
agencies can borrow funds to finance long-term projects at costs as low as
they have been over the past half-century, as shown in Figure 6-5. This is
true even taking into account expected inflation rates. Long term real interest rates have moved decidedly lower in past decades (CEA 2015).
Given historically low borrowing costs and the potential upside boosts
to short-run demand and long-run supply, investing in infrastructure would
offer benefits that, according to Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley
Fischer (2015), “under current circumstances would outweigh the costs of
its financing.” Infrastructure investments promote current economic activity, augment the value of public capital stocks in the long run, and alleviate
the burden on future generations of making needed infrastructure upgrades.
During a period of low growth for an advanced economy, the large boost to

output in the near term from high-efficiency public investment can reduce
the public-debt-to-GDP ratio (IMF 2014).

Maintenance and Repair
Infrastructure maintenance and repair can generate high returns on
investment. Infrastructure depreciates over time, and does so more rapidly
when it is used more intensively. Operation and maintenance expenditures
allow infrastructure to function properly, deliver its promised benefits, and
enable repair of structurally deficient assets. Neglecting proper maintenance
and system preservation leads to deficient infrastructure conditions such as
roads filled with potholes, traffic delays, power outages, and so on—which
can impose sizable short-run costs on its users.
Investing in maintenance is a cost-effective technique for avoiding
more expensive repairs in the future. One estimate is that every $1 spent
on preventive pavement maintenance reduces future repair costs by $4 to
$10 (Baladi et al. 2002). Transportation engineers have developed economic
methods that determine the optimal timing for applying preventive maintenance treatments to flexible and rigid pavements by assessing the benefits
and costs for each year the treatment could be applied (Peshkin, Hoerner,
and Zimmerman 2004). Allowing the condition of transportation infrastructure to deteriorate exacerbates wear and tear on vehicles. Cars and trucks
that drive more frequently on substandard roads will require tire changes
or other repairs more often—estimated to cost each driver, on average, an
additional $516 annually in vehicle maintenance (TRIP 2015). Delaying
maintenance can also induce more accidents on transit systems. Not repaving a road, replacing a rail, reinforcing a bridge, or restoring a runway can
result in increased vehicle crashes that can disrupt transportation flows and
create substantial safety hazards.
The conceptual relationship between spending on maintenance versus new infrastructure and its impact on economic growth is depicted in
Figure 6-6. The two are not perfect substitutes, as the latter adds directly to
the stock of public capital while the former offsets depreciation on existing
infrastructure (Kalaitzidakis and Kalyvitis 2005). Assuming that infrastructure investments are implemented efficiently, effectively, and optimally,
then if spending on maintenance is too low relative to new capital investment or vice versa, economic output will grow at a rate below its potential.
To maximize economic growth from increased public investment
in infrastructure, governments must properly balance the needs for new
infrastructure with those for maintaining the infrastructure that is currently
in place. The ratio of public spending on operation and maintenance to
new capital for water and transportation infrastructure in the United States

since 1956 is shown in Figure 6-7. From 1956 to 1970, the ratio of public
spending on operation and maintenance to public spending on new capital
for water and transportation infrastructure averaged 0.61—meaning that
for every $1 spent toward new capital, $0.61 was spent on operation and
maintenance. This relatively low public spending ratio largely reflected
increased spending toward the continued construction of the Interstate
Highway System. Over the 35 years that followed, the public spending ratio
for operation and maintenance to new capital averaged 1.00—indicating
a balanced approach between funding needs for new capital with those
for operation and maintenance. Since then, public spending on water and
transportation infrastructure has shifted toward supporting the operation
and maintenance of current infrastructure relative to the formation of new
capital more heavily than it did in the five decades prior, averaging a public
spending ratio of 1.20. Although it is unclear what the optimal ratio is, what
is clear is that maximizing growth requires spending on new infrastructure
and maintaining in-place assets, not focusing solely on one and entirely
ignoring the other.

Managing and Funding Infrastructure Projects
Beyond the need for infrastructure and the economic gains that can
result from a well-designed investment, a crucial decision in the infrastructure investment process is how to manage and fund such investments.

User Fees
If infrastructure is funded through conventional methods that rely on
general government revenues, all taxpayers bear the costs of new projects.
But through a user-fee system, only those who actually use the services
that the new infrastructure provides are required to pay for it, which could
present a more equitable and viable funding mechanism as long as a project
does not generate extensive externalities or spillovers. If there are substantial
spillovers, charging for use may dissuade users and lead to a socially inefficient outcome. One potential downfall of the user-fee approach is that
revenues are dependent on demand. If the demand for a new transportation
asset was over-estimated, then the revenue generated from user fees would
be below expectations, causing the entity financially responsible for it to bear
the shortfall—though this could lead governments and private entities to
be more prudent when selecting which projects to undertake.7 However, if
7 One noteworthy example is the Virginia Dulles Greenway project, which defaulted on its
bonds in its first few years because predicted demand for the new road system was too rosy.

278  |  Chapter 6

there is a clear demand for an infrastructure project—which could be gauged
by surveying households and firms, noting that there are heavily congested
transportation structures nearby, or recognizing the need for maintenance
on popular commuter routes—user fees can be an effective approach for
funding its development. Although they may be cost effective, user fees are
inherently exclusionary because consumers must pay to utilize the structure,
which can limit access for low- and moderate-income households.

Public-Private Partnerships
Public-private partnerships (PPPs)—where governments contract
with a private firm for provision of some or all aspects of an infrastructure
project—have received increasing consideration and use in recent decades in
the United States (Buckberg, Kearney, and Stolleman 2015), though they are
relied on more heavily in other advanced economies, including Australia,
Canada, and the United Kingdom. In July 2014, President Barack Obama
launched the Build America Investment Initiative, a government-wide
initiative to boost infrastructure investment that includes expanding the
market for public-private partnerships. The adoption of PPP financing for
infrastructure projects in the United States has been gradual (likely due to
the availability of inexpensive financing in the U.S. municipal debt market).
Through 2007, less than 15 transportation PPPs had reached financial close
in the United States (Engel, Fischer, and Galetovic 2011). As of 2015, PPPs
were a feature of approximately 60 infrastructure projects for new facilities
in various stages of completion across the United States, with mixed degrees
of private-sector involvement (DOT 2015b); more than 15 reached financial
close in the three-year period ended April 2015.8,9
PPPs can provide a means for avoiding two of the major pitfalls
that typically affect an infrastructure project designed and delivered using
conventional methods of public funding. First, under the more standard
approach to infrastructure provision, each of a number of firms or government entities may be called on to complete individual stand-alone elements
of the project. As a result, these firms face incentives to minimize their
own costs in providing their single element of the project, without regard
for the quality or costliness of the project as a whole. More concretely, the
segmented nature of the infrastructure provision process means that private
8 Financial close occurs when all of the project and financing agreements have been signed and
project implementation can start.
9 These PPPs are not uniform as to the project phases that are assigned to the private sector;
different project characteristics necessitate different risk sharing arrangements. Roughly 25 of
the projects assigned only the responsibilities of designing and building to the private sector,
while more than 20 stipulated that the private sector design, build, finance, operate, and
maintain the structure.

The Economic Benefits of Investing in U.S. Infrastructure | 279

firms that are not ultimately responsible for operating or maintaining a
structure have less incentive to adopt designs or construction methods that
minimize total costs over the project’s complete life cycle, which includes its
construction, operation, and maintenance. By contrast, and depending on
how the contract is structured, PPPs can “bundle” the responsibilities of different project phases, so that, for example, a single private firm is responsible
for the design, construction, financing, operation, and maintenance of the
infrastructure asset. This arrangement provides strong incentives for ontime project delivery and cost minimization over the entire life cycle of the
structure (Hart 2003), though PPPs can also be organized so that the private
sector is responsible for just some of the phases of the project.
Second, given that the public sector would still be responsible for
funding the project under conventional provision, the government would
incur most or all of the risk associated with its underutilization or inadequate
performance. In other words, should actual use of a project fall short of its
expected level, or prove substandard in terms of its engineering or design,
the responsible government agency—and ultimately, the taxpayers—would
bear much or all of the resulting financial strain. On the other hand, the
bundled nature of PPPs allows at least some of the demand and performance
risks associated with the project to be transferred from the government
agency sponsoring the project to the contracting firm (Buckberg, Kearney,
and Stolleman 2015). This arrangement also serves to promote more effective project design and efficient construction. It may even ensure that more
reliable and cost-effective materials are used, thus ensuring longevity and
reducing the frequency of required maintenance.10
Nevertheless, because PPPs have potential drawbacks, it is critical to
design them carefully and use them only when appropriate. PPPs in which
a government compensates the private entity directly through availability
payments do not reduce the demand risk borne by the government, because
the private partner must be paid as long as the infrastructure service meets
contracted quality standards, even if actual utilization of the service is far
below expectations. This drawback, however, can be overcome. Partnerships
between government agencies and private firms can be structured to mitigate the demand risks faced by the government in developing a new infrastructure asset. For example, a PPP contract could stipulate that the private
firm finance the project and receive compensation through the collection of

10 This incentive is especially relevant if the builder is also responsible for the maintenance of
the structure.

280  |  Chapter 6

user fees or shadow tolls.11 Through this mechanism, the government could
mitigate downside risks such as project cost overruns or revenue shortfalls,
thereby insulating the government from budgetary risks associated with
unexpected developments. However, private investors may require a higher
rate of return on their investment in exchange for being exposed to these
uncertainties.12
Another risk associated with PPPs is that by outsourcing some or all
elements of a project to private businesses, the government relinquishes
some of its control over planning, constructing, and potentially even operating and maintaining the structure. Although this feature is often seen as
beneficial in that the private sector is perceived as being able to manage the
project more efficiently, there still exists the risk that the private firm will
fail to meet its obligations or that its efforts will lead to excessively high user
fees. Moreover, because of their large scale of operation, infrastructure assets
often have characteristics of natural monopolies: they can be unique in the
role they play for given transportation markets, which in turn may eliminate
the need or potential for competing options, which raises the possibility of
excessively high prices or profit. Finally, many of the same principal-agent
problems that arise in standard public finance, where officials may not make
the best decisions on behalf of the public, can arise in PPPs. For example,
if local authorities are myopic—with a horizon of the next election or next
budget cycle primarily on their minds—they could strike a sub-optimal deal
that casts them in a positive light in the short run, but is inefficient in the
long term.
While infrastructure assets procured through PPPs are usually returned
to public sector control after a contractually stipulated period, many of the
perceived risks mentioned above can be mitigated through effective contract
design. The government can retain a certain level of control—regulatory
or otherwise—over the private entity or entities. A contract can stipulate
quality levels that structures must satisfy, restrict the prices that can be
charged for using assets, and require sharing of excess revenues or profit
as well as shortfalls in order to achieve a balanced and mutually acceptable
11 Shadow tolls involve periodic payments from the government to the private firm based
on how many users the asset attracts per time period. Like user fees, shadow tolls provide an
incentive for the private party to construct and manage the asset efficiently, thus transferring
demand risk from the government to the private party. Shadow tolls differ though in that they
require that the government funds the private entity.
12 Importantly, paying a higher return to the private partner to bear the demand risk need not
result in the project realizing efficiency gains. In contrast to bundled design and construction
risk, for example, the transfer of demand risk to the private partner in and of itself will not
induce it to take actions that lower the overall cost of the project. This is due to the fact that
the private partner can do little to affect utilization, unlike the way in which its actions can
substantially affect overall design and construction costs.

allocation of risks (Buckberg, Kearney, and Stollman 2015). Governments
can also institute requirements for competitive bidding processes that are
transparent and objective. In contracting the responsibility of financing an
infrastructure project to the private sector, State and local governments can
also initiate the development of new assets without having the budgetary
resources necessary for financing.

The Role of the Federal Government
With the exception of freight railroads, the Federal Government
plays a key role in funding and developing transportation infrastructure. A
Federal presence is particularly valuable when these transportation projects
offer multi-state or nationwide benefits. One reason for Federal involvement
is that State and local governments may undervalue the benefits of new
infrastructure projects by not accounting fully for their positive spillover
effects on nearby areas. States and localities may not have financial capacity
to build new infrastructure assets or to provide maintenance for structures
in need of extensive repair. Without Federal assistance, such initiatives may
be repeatedly postponed or bypassed entirely because of budgetary restrictions, causing their potential benefits to be delayed or foregone completely.
Additionally, the private sector may lack the incentives or resources needed
to adequately complete or operate new transportation infrastructure projects, which are often large and complex.
The Federal Government has an essential role in helping transportation planners and project managers collaborate on transportation
infrastructure investments across jurisdictional and geographic boundaries.
These efforts can enhance the economic competitiveness of metropolitan
and non-metropolitan areas along major corridors that are critical for supporting current and future freight and passenger flows. Federal expertise
and resources are used to promote comprehensive multimodal planning that
better integrates safety into surface transportation projects. For example,
Federal law requires that the State and metropolitan transportation planning
processes be consistent with Strategic Highway Safety Plans.
The Federal Government has the capacity to stimulate improvements
in infrastructure that maintain the resilience of the national economy,
coordinate multi-state planning for emergencies, and protect and repair
interconnected transportation systems. Recent extreme weather events such
as hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Sandy, the 2012 national drought, the recent
California drought, and other natural disasters have demonstrated the disruptions and other costs that can result from inadequate investment in infrastructure supporting multiple transportation modes. In 2005, the damage

282  |  Chapter 6

to transportation facilities caused by hurricanes Katrina and Rita totaled
more than $1.1 billion, in addition to the costs to repair the I-10 Twin Span
Bridge as well as repair and replace rail lines, pipelines, ports, waterways,
and airports (Transportation Research Board 2008). In 2012, Hurricane
Sandy flooded roads, subways, airport runways, marine terminals, and
railroad tracks in New York and New Jersey, illustrating the widespread and
cascading effects of disasters and justifying a Federal response for assistance
and coordination. The costs associated with these extreme events include
prolonged disruption of transportation systems, substantial capital damage,
suppressed economic activity, and even loss of life.
The Federal Government contributes to infrastructure investment
through direct expenditures and with incentives indirectly provided through
the tax system, sometimes referred to as tax expenditures. The direct expenditures are spending on infrastructure (such as funding of dams and water
resources) and grants and loan subsidies to states for transportation projects.
States and localities have operational control over how the money is spent,
though they must comply with certain conditions to receive Federal funding. The Federal Government subsidizes the issuance of municipal bonds
by offering tax preferences that lower the cost of debt for transportation
projects. State and local governments typically finance infrastructure projects with tax-preferred bonds, which are repaid with general tax receipts
or from revenues collected from users of the infrastructure project. Public
infrastructure investments by the private sector may also be eligible for taxpreferred financing through Private Activity Bonds if 95 percent or more
of the bond proceeds are used for surface transportation or other qualified
projects. State and local governments typically determine whether to provide
private financing for public infrastructure investments in their jurisdictions.
Federal funding and financing programs for transportation infrastructure
are discussed below.

Federal Grants
One avenue through which the Federal Government has funded
infrastructure investment is the Transportation Investment Generating
Economic Recovery (TIGER) discretionary grant program, which was initially created as part of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
to fund highway, transit, rail, port, and other surface transportation projects
subsequently funded through annual appropriations. The TIGER program
developed a merit-based competitive approach for local project sponsors
to obtain Federal funds, where projects are evaluated based on the extent
to which they promote the strategic goals of maintaining the Nation’s economic competitiveness, ensuring environmental sustainability, improving
The Economic Benefits of Investing in U.S. Infrastructure | 283

the livability of communities, making transportation safer, and maintaining
infrastructure in a state of good repair. A Government Accountability Office
(2014) review of 20 projects from 2009 to 2012 showed that about half of
the total construction costs for TIGER projects were funded by non-Federal
sources with sizable contributions from counties, cities, and other local
agencies. Notably, every dollar invested through the TIGER program generated an estimated co-investment of 3.5 dollars, highlighting the effectiveness
of the program.
The TIGER grants promote a merit-based competitive approach to
directing Federal investment in transportation infrastructure. The TIGER
eligibility requirements allow funding for multi-modal, multi-jurisdictional
projects along with port and freight rail projects, all of which may have
limited access to Federal funds. TIGER can provide capital funding directly
to any public entity, including municipalities, counties, port authorities, and
tribal governments, in contrast to traditional Federal transportation programs that provide funding primarily to State departments of transportation
and public transit agencies. A survey of state experiences with the TIGER
grant program showed that the opportunity to utilize long-standing Federal
expertise in planning transportation investments allowed many states to find
new and innovative ways to speed up project delivery. The TIGER program
has been heavily oversubscribed with a 20:1 ratio of requests to available
funding, reflecting a large demand for high-quality infrastructure projects
across the country.

Federal Lending and Loan Guarantees
The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act
(TIFIA) lending program assists State and local governments in financing infrastructure projects, such as toll roads, that are supported by user
fees. Created in 1998 as part of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st
Century, the program has authorized approximately $3 billion of Federal
funds to cover $22 billion of loans. The program’s fundamental goal is to
leverage Federal funds by attracting private and non-federal co-investment
in surface transportation infrastructure projects, such as highways, bridges,
intercity passenger rails, certain types of freight rail, and public transit.
TIFIA requires that two-thirds of project costs come from State, local, or
private sources. Borrowers benefit from improved access to capital markets
and can potentially achieve earlier completion of large-scale, capital intensive projects. The program has become increasingly popular since its inception and was relied on widely during the financial crisis (Altman, Klein, and
Krueger 2015). The FAST Act (discussed below) reduced TIFIA’s annual
authority from $1 billion to an average of $287 million a year.
284  |  Chapter 6

Tax-Exempt Bonds
Transportation infrastructure projects provide a long-term stream
of benefits and, with appropriate fee structures, can generate revenues
for repayment over time from users of the projects. Construction of these
projects is often financed through borrowing by State and local governments. Municipal bonds are issued by States and localities to finance a broad
spectrum of public infrastructure, including roads, bridges, airports, utility
systems, schools, and a limited number of private sector activities. The
Federal government subsidizes the issuance of municipal bonds by offering
tax exemptions and other preferences that lower the cost of issuing debt for
these projects.
Tax-exempt bonds, which pay interest to bondholders that is not
subject to Federal income taxes, are the dominant and most well-established
type of tax-preferred debt, dating from the beginning of the Federal income
tax in 1913 (CBO 2009). Purchasers of this debt are willing to accept a lower
interest rate compared to rates offered on taxable debt of comparable risk
and maturity. Infrastructure project development is stimulated when States
and localities can readily access low-cost financing, and tax-exempt bonds
reduce the borrowing costs they incur, thus encouraging infrastructure
development. When State and local governments issue bonds, they retain
control over capital projects, so priorities for infrastructure projects and
decisions on the value and timing of tax-exempt debt issues are made by
State and local governments. These entities repay all principal and interest
on such debt, while the Federal government effectively contributes a smaller
portion by foregoing tax revenue it would otherwise collect.
From 2004 through 2013, the amount of tax-preferred debt issued
to finance new infrastructure projects initiated by the public and private
sectors totaled $2.02 trillion.13 About 73 percent, or approximately $1.5
trillion, was used by States and localities. Private capital investments to fund
projects with a public purpose such as hospitals or housing accounted for the
remainder (about $542 billion).
After falling substantially during the Great Recession, the amount of
new tax-exempt debt issued each year has rebounded considerably. Since
2010, long-term government bond issues have grown at a rate of 15.2 percent, driven primarily by two factors. First, the demand for debt financing
reflects expanded investment in public infrastructure projects. Second, the
steady decline in interest rates charged to municipal borrowers has provided
cheaper options for borrowers to finance capital spending by issuing debt.
13 CEA calculations drawn from Tax-Exempt Bond Statistics data through the Internal
Revenue Service. The bond issuance data cover long-term maturity debt (13 months or more),
which is generally used to finance construction or other capital improvement projects.

The Economic Benefits of Investing in U.S. Infrastructure | 285

Transportation bonds accounted for a major share—nearly 18 percent—of
governmental obligations issued to finance new investment in infrastructure from 2010 to 2013. Excluding housing—which accounts for less than
1 percent of tax-exempt government bonds—transportation has been the
fastest-growing use of tax-exempt government bonds, rising on average just
over 28 percent a year since 2010.

Build America Bonds
Another way the Federal government has provided resources for
infrastructure recently is through the Build America Bonds (BABs) program.
BABs, introduced as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act,
were designed to encourage State and local governments to invest in economically critical infrastructure projects. State and local governments were
authorized to issue special taxable bonds that received either a 35-percent
direct federal subsidy to the borrower (Direct Payment BABs) or a Federal
tax credit worth 35 percent of the interest owed to investors (Tax Credit
BABs). BABs broadened the pool of investors and eased the supply pressure
in the municipal bond market while bringing down borrowing costs.
Through the BABs program, the U.S. Department of the Treasury was
able to harness the efficiencies of the taxable debt market, resulting in lower
average borrowing costs for States and localities. State and local governments
were able to obtain cheaper financing (averaging about 54 basis points) than
through the regular municipal bond market (Ang, Bhansali, and Xing 2010).
On a present value basis, BAB issuers saved an estimated $20 billion in
borrowing costs compared to traditional tax-exempt municipal debt (U.S.
Department of the Treasury 2011). This savings was considerably greater
than the net cost to the Federal Government from the BABs program. The
program lasted roughly 20 months, and 2,275 separate BABs amounting to
$181 billion were issued by State and local governments across all 50 states,
the District of Columbia, and two territories. Unlike other infrastructure
programs, BABs were not divided equally across states but were distributed
on the basis of the demand for new infrastructure by states and localities.
The result was that the 100 largest metropolitan areas accounted for nearly
half of all funding for BABs issuances.
The BABs program was successful in spurring investment in economically critical infrastructure projects across the country and stimulated
job-intensive projects. From 2009 through the program’s expiration in 2010,
BABs financed a third of all new State and local government long-term debt
issuances.

Recent Legislation
In December 2015, President Barack Obama signed into law the Fixing
America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, which authorized roughly
$306 billion in spending for highways, transit, rail, and safety over the next
five years. While the FAST Act offered important benefits by increasing
transportation funding and providing greater certainty on funding over the
coming years, it fell short of the level of investment needed to fully modernize U.S. infrastructure and the $478 billion that the Administration proposed
as part of its GROW AMERICA proposal. Of that approved spending,
approximately $226 billion has been designated for highways and approximately $61 billion for transit projects. Based on CEA assumptions about
the future rates of inflation, these dollar amounts translate to increases in
investment of about 4 percent for highways and 7 percent for transit in real
terms. The law also reauthorized the collection of Federal taxes on gasoline
and other fuels, which are frequently used to fund transportation projects
and raise approximately $35 billion in revenues annually—with most of the
tax revenue stemming from gasoline (18.4 cents per gallon) and diesel fuels
(24.4 cents per gallon).
The FAST Act established new Federal grant programs, expanded current programs, and furthered initiatives to improve safety and innovation.
The Act established the Nationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects
competitive grant program aimed to support economically beneficial projects that will facilitate improved freight movement. This $4.5 billion discretionary grant program will be complemented by $6.3 billion in Federal-aid
formula funding for states to invest directly into projects that contribute to
the efficient movement of goods. The FAST Act also established the FederalState Partnership for State of Good Repair grant program to improve critical
passenger rail assets for which maintenance had been deferred as well as the
Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements program to support rail projects more generally.
The Act expanded State eligibility for Federal lending through TIFIA
and the Railroad Rehabilitation Improvement and Financing programs.
The application processes for these programs will be consolidated into
the Surface Transportation Innovative Finance Bureau within the Office
of the Secretary of Transportation, another FAST Act creation, which
will strengthen the programs through streamlined review and transparent approval processes. The Innovative Finance Bureau will also help to
promote public-private partnership procurements of large-scale infrastructure projects through expanded technical assistance. The Act established
a formula freight program, to be administered by the Federal Highway
Administration, which will fund critical transportation projects that would

Box 6-4: 21st Century Clean Transportation Plan
The President’s fiscal year 2017 budget proposes a 21st Century
Clean Transportation Plan that expands investments in clean transportation infrastructure by 50 percent above current levels in nominal
terms. The 21st Century Clean Transportation Plan consists of four
components designed to put America on a long-term course to reduce
reliance on oil, cut carbon pollution, and strengthen resilience to the
adverse impacts of climate change. The initiative aims to transform our
transportation system using targeted Federal investments, to stimulate
State and local innovations in smarter, cleaner, and regional transportation systems, to accelerate the adoption of low-carbon technologies,
autonomous vehicles, and intelligent transportation systems, and to
provide funding to maintain and increase the safety of our transportation systems as they evolve.
Innovative methods to reduce congestion, manage sprawl, and
improve air quality while providing affordable access to jobs are essential
as the United States experiences continued population growth in midsized and large urban areas. The program will distribute capital funds
to expand transit systems in cities, suburbs, and rural areas, and make
high-speed rail a viable alternative to flying in major regional corridors.
Other targeted investments include funding to invest in new rail technologies, modernize the Nation’s freight system, and expand support
for the TIGER competitive grant program for innovative local road, rail,
transit, and port projects.
A second component of the initiative will assist State and local
governments to develop smarter and cleaner regional transportation
systems. The plan provides incentives for State and local governments to
maximize the returns on public investments and deliver more efficient
results by reforming existing transportation formula funding. The
initiative creates a Climate Smart Fund to reward states that leverage
Federal funding to cut carbon pollution and improve efficiency in the
transportation sector.
The plan advances specific proposals to promote the adoption
of low-carbon, cost-competitive intelligent transportation systems.
Working with State and local governments and leveraging public-private
partnerships, the initiative sets the goal that all Americans have access
to at least one alternative transportation fuel by 2020, including electric
vehicle charging, advanced biofuel fuel pumps, and others low-carbon
options.

benefit freight movements. The Act also provided funds to improve transportation safety by supporting projects that will alleviate highway congestion, reduce accidents, and improve rail safety.
Included in the President’s fiscal year 2017 budget is a proposal,
discussed in Box 6-4, to expand the development of clean transportation
infrastructure.

Conclusion
As discussed throughout this chapter, infrastructure investment is
important for the economy. At its core, strengthening our Nation’s transportation infrastructure improves economic opportunities for both households
and businesses, and supports the interconnectivity of individuals, firms, and
regions. In the long run, investing in infrastructure boosts the economy’s
productivity and thus spurs output growth. Reliable infrastructure facilitates
the efficient exchange of goods, labor, and innovative ideas. From the Erie
Canal in the early 1800s to the Transcontinental Railroad in the 1860s, to
the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s and 1960s, previous generations
of Americans have made these investments, and they were instrumental in
putting the country on a path for sustained economic growth.
By 2040, our population is expected to increase by more than 60 million
people, and continued investment in infrastructure is essential to increasing
productivity and spurring continued economic growth. Improvements in
infrastructure provide more capital to the economy, thereby increasing labor
productivity, reducing congestion and time lost in traffic, and enhancing
market efficiency. Workers benefit from reduced commuting times, making
it easier for them to move between jobs and expanding labor force opportunities. Businesses are able to manage their inventories more efficiently
and transport goods faster and more cheaply, helping them to access new
suppliers and markets. Concentrated investment in infrastructure may even
draw market participants together and build new cooperative efficiencies,
magnifying the resulting productivity gains. By making these investments
in a smart way, we can make our transportation system both more efficient
and more climate friendly.
Investing in U.S. infrastructure boosts both short-run demand and
long-run supply. The former generates new economic activity by increasing employment and workers’ earnings. The longer-run effect stems
from increased productivity in the use of labor, private capital, and other
resources, thus allowing opportunities for both consumers and businesses to
flourish. Sufficient infrastructure, especially that supporting transportation,
is a fundamental underpinning of continued economic prosperity. Whether

it is flying across the country, shipping goods across state borders, or simply commuting to work each day, households and firms alike depend on
adequate infrastructure. As our economy strives to increase investment and
productivity, public spending on infrastructure can play an important role.

THE 70 TH ANNIVERSARY
OF THE COUNCIL OF
ECONOMIC ADVISERS

A

lmost exactly 70 years ago, on February 20, 1946, President Harry
Truman signed the Employment Act of 1946 into law. Born out
of America’s experience during the Great Depression, this law reflected
Congress’s desire to prevent an economic calamity of that scale from ever
recurring. Yet the immediate practical consequences of the Employment
Act were modest: it created two institutions, the Joint Economic Committee
on the Economic Report—subsequently renamed the Joint Economic
Committee (JEC)—and the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA). Together
with the JEC, it was hoped that CEA would help to “defend the ramparts
against depression” (Flash 1965).
CEA is in many ways a distinctive institution, both within the administration and in the international context. The CEA chair reports directly to
the President on economic issues, but CEA has no regulatory authority and
few prescribed operational responsibilities. For most of its history, CEA has
had a small staff drawn mostly from the academic economics community
and hired on the basis of professional expertise. The views it expresses are
grounded in economic analysis, and are based on applying economic theory
and empirical research to the often-novel situations in which policymakers
find themselves.
However, CEA is also a part of the Executive Office of the President,
working collaboratively with other departments within the Executive
Office of the President and the administration more broadly to advance
the President’s agenda. CEA plays a distinctive role in the administration,
but like other components of the administration, it also communicates and
operates as part of a team on behalf of the President.
While the Council has made useful contributions to economic policymaking throughout its history, its role and influence have varied depending
291

on the needs of the President, the economic issues facing the country, and
the personnel of CEA itself. Because CEA has no fixed statutory responsibilities except for assisting in the preparation of the annual Economic Report of
the President, its role and influence depend on the degree to which it can be
useful and relevant to the President and other senior decision makers.
On the 70th Anniversary of the Employment Act of 1946, this chapter
explores the origins of the Council of Economic Advisers, describes its core
functions, and examines several key moments from its history. The chapter first examines the legislative origins of CEA and provides an overview
of its institutional structure and policy priorities. It then focuses on four
interrelated functions of CEA: helping to develop and evaluate economic
policies for consideration by the President and the administration; helping
to advance the President’s economic agenda; gathering, analyzing, and interpreting information on economic trends and developments, and informing
the President about the state of the economy; and engaging the economics
community. The chapter draws on historical examples and former CEA
chairs’ and members’ accounts—including boxes from six former chairs
about their experiences at CEA—to illustrate each of these functions and
their inherent challenges, and identifies several institutional lessons for
ensuring CEA’s continued effectiveness.

Goals and Duties
Origins of CEA—Legislative History of the Employment Act of
1946
The Employment Act ultimately signed into law in February 1946 was
markedly different from the original bill that Senator James E. Murray introduced in the Senate in January 1945. The original Senate bill (S.380), which
was called the Full Employment Act, aimed to “set postwar economic policy
in a simple Keynesian mold” (Stein 1988), through “solidly entrench[ing]
a strong bias toward active countercyclical fiscal policy in the core of the
American executive branch” (DeLong 1996). S.380 provided that the government first define full employment, and then “establish and maintain
programs to ensure an inflation-free, fully employed economy” (Mills 1988).
The operational plan included the following key points:
(1) [I]t would be the responsibility of the federal government to
ensure that anyone wishing to work would be able to locate a job;
(2) the [P]resident was to prepare each year a National Production
and Employment Budget which would include estimates of the size

292  |  Chapter 7

and composition of the labor force, investment plans for all levels of
government, plus those of the private sector; (3) if insufficient investment existed to provide full employment, then the [P]resident would
develop programs to achieve this level of employment. He was to
have similar responsibility for, and powers over, the control of inflation; (4) this budget was to be prepared in the Executive Office of
the President; and (5) this bill would establish a Joint Congressional
Committee on the National Budget to study the [P]resident’s document and either recommend or change any legislation implied in it”
(Mills 1988).
By contrast, the House substitute bill, called the Employment and
Production Act of 1946, “rejected the fundamental principles of the Senate
bill” (Bailey 1950). It removed the declaration of the Federal Government’s
responsibility for maintaining full employment, the accompanying commitment of government resources, the affirmation of the right to employment
opportunity, and the National Production and Employment Budget program. It also provided for a Council of Economic Advisers to be “composed
of three members at $15,000 a year, whose duties were to submit recommendations to the President whenever inflation or unemployment threatened, to
consult with economic groups, and to submit annual and quarterly reports
on economic trends” (Bailey 1950).
The Employment Act that emerged from the Joint Conference
Committee and was signed into law reflects an attempt to reconcile the
profoundly different economic views contained in the House and Senate
bills. In the final law, the words “full employment” were ultimately replaced
with “maximum employment, production and purchasing power.” The law
also included language specifying that part of the Federal Government’s
purpose is “to foster and promote free competitive enterprise.” Instead of the
National Production and Employment Budget, the law called for an annual
Economic Report of the President, “setting forth . . . current and foreseeable
trends in the levels of employment, production, and purchasing power . . .
and a program for carrying out the policy [to promote] conditions under
which there will be afforded useful employment for those able, willing, and
seeking to work” (Employment Act 1946; DeLong 1996). Meanwhile, the
language from the House bill establishing the Council of Economic Advisers
was kept mostly intact.1
1 The law also established what is now known as the Joint Economic Committee, a standing
joint committee of Congress, whose original functions were to coordinate economic
policymaking, to monitor the subjects in the Economic Report, and to produce its own yearly
report in response to the President’s Economic Report (Tollestrup 2015).

The 70th Anniversary of the Council of Economic Advisers  |  293

The balance struck in the final Employment Act meant that CEA’s
role could be interpreted differently depending on whether one emphasizes
the language from the House bill or from the Senate bill. Because of this
dichotomy, from the beginning, the Council faced “a divergence of expectations regarding its brand of economic analysis, its policy recommendations,
and its mode of operations” (Flash 1965). Consistent with that initial diversity of views, CEA has focused on different policies over the course of its
history, as discussed in this chapter.

Institutional Structure
CEA has an unusual—and perhaps unique—institutional structure.
Partially due to concerns about Executive Branch overreach during the
Roosevelt Administration, Congress intentionally provided CEA with limited resources and specified a Council of three rather than one single adviser.
CEA is currently headed by a chair and two members, each of whom is
required to be “exceptionally qualified” to analyze economic developments
and recommend economic policy (Employment Act 1946).2 Today, CEA’s
staff is composed of academic economists and economics graduate students
who are on leave from their university positions, career government economists on temporary assignment from other agencies, some recent college
graduates who have studied economics, and a small statistical, forecasting,
and administrative staff.
Unlike in many other governments, where the top professional
economist reports to the finance minister or another cabinet minister, the
CEA chair is expected to participate at the Cabinet level in discussions about
economic policy. Although in some other countries, such as Germany, the
government has a separate set of economic advisers who are expected to
make independent recommendations, they are not integrated into day-today government decision-making in the same way as CEA.
CEA’s institutional structure has shaped the role that it plays in economic policymaking. For example, CEA’s lack of regulatory authority and
its few operational responsibilities mean that its influence depends largely on
its relationship with the President and the rest of the Executive Branch. As
such, CEA’s influence has waxed and waned at various points in its history,
depending on the strength of these relationships as well as the soundness
and persuasiveness of its analysis. However, CEA’s position in the Executive
Office of the President also allows it to take a broader perspective on economic policy and place less weight on the day-to-day exigencies of running
the Federal Government. As former CEA Chairman Martin Feldstein put
2 As a result of the Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act of 2011, the two
non-chair CEA members no longer require Senate confirmation.

294  |  Chapter 7

it, “[t]he CEA and its chairman have the luxury of trying to discern what is
in the best interest of the country and of providing that analysis and advice
directly to the [P]resident and to the cabinet as a whole” (1992).
Similarly, CEA’s small size has also had a strong influence on how it
functions. Being a small organization has enabled CEA to be more flexible,
efficient, less rigid and hierarchical, and less formal than would be possible
otherwise. However, it also means that CEA plays a limited role in more
expansive and resource-intensive matters, consistent with its lack of formal
regulatory and operational responsibilities.
Both Roger Porter, a scholar of the American Presidency and former
White House economic adviser, and former CEA Chairman R. Glenn
Hubbard argue that CEA’s small size, its professional reputation, and its
limited operational responsibilities have contributed to its longevity (Porter
1997; Hubbard 2002). Porter notes that “of the nearly 50 entities that have
been located in the Executive Office of the President since it was created in
1939, the CEA is one of only 11 that remain” (1997).

Policy Focus
CEA’s policy focus has evolved over the years. While countercyclical
fiscal policy was the focus of the Employment Act of 1946, CEA has long
since worked on a variety of other microeconomic and macroeconomic
issues. For example, CEA works on macroeconomic subjects such as longterm growth, financial markets, and international macroeconomics. CEA
helps to frame public discussions on macroeconomic policy, and it chairs
the “Troika” forecasting process—an interagency system first formed during
the Kennedy Administration, in which the Council of Economic Advisers,
the Department of the Treasury, and the Office of Management and Budget
jointly produce regular macroeconomic forecasts used for planning the
President’s Budget (see Box 7-1 for former CEA Chair Laura D’Andrea
Tyson’s discussion of the difficulty of economic forecasting and the role of
fiscal policy in the Clinton Administration).
While macroeconomic issues continue to be an important part of
CEA’s portfolio, in recent decades CEA has devoted an increasing amount
of attention to microeconomic issues that arise in the context of legislation, regulatory processes, and other administrative actions. Former CEA
Chairman Charles Schultze reports that the proportion of CEA’s annual
Economic Report focused on microeconomic subjects grew dramatically
from 1947 through 1995 (1996).
This evolution is due to a number of factors. In part, it reflects a
reduced emphasis by the economics profession on fiscal policy as a macroeconomic tool and an increased recognition of the importance of monetary

Box 7-1: Former CEA Chair Laura D’Andrea Tyson (1993 – 1995)
A primary responsibility of CEA along with OMB and the Treasury
is the development of economic forecasts on which the administration’s
annual and long-term budget projections depend. The budget deficit,
widely used as an indicator of fiscal policy stance and central to political
debates, is highly sensitive to the economy’s performance. Yet forecasting that performance is an exercise fraught with uncertainty and subject
to significant errors that get larger as the forecasting period lengthens.
In January 1993, at the beginning of the Clinton Presidency, the
economy was underperforming relative to forecasts, and much weaker
than expected macroeconomic conditions were producing much higher
than expected budget deficits. Confronting a deteriorating budgetary
outlook, the new Clinton CEA worked with the rest of the Clinton
economic team to develop a budget plan to cut the deficit by $500 billion over 5 years while honoring the President’s top fiscal priorities to
increase public investment and expand the earned income tax credit. The
administration’s economic forecasts underpinning this plan reflected
the prevailing consensus among economists that the growth rate of
potential output was around 2.5%, resting on a labor productivity growth
rate in the 1.2% range, and a NAIRU of about 5.5%. Yet this prevailing
consensus proved to be wrong—during the next five years, the economy
outperformed the administration’s forecasts by a considerable margin.
But in January 1995, despite passage of Clinton’s budget plan
in August 1993 and the stronger than expected economic conditions
it fostered, projected budget deficits were still increasing, albeit at a
slower pace, and the new Republican controlled Congress was demanding an administration plan to balance the budget within 7 years. As
the underlying economic forecasts improved, CEA helped craft a new
administration plan to achieve balance within 10 years without economically indefensible cuts in spending in priority areas including health care,
education, infrastructure and research. The administration’s plan was
rejected by Congress, which used government shutdowns and threats of
default on the federal debt to force the administration’s hand. These tactics failed and in 1996, the administration and Congress agreed instead
on a modest budget package that funded the government at current-law
levels.
The economy continued to outperform forecasts, and CEA worked
with President Clinton to develop a plan to balance the budget in 5 years.
He announced the plan in February 1997 shortly after his re-election.
Critics accused the President of “flip flopping” on the budget, but
what had changed was not his fiscal policy stance, but the surprisingly
strong economic conditions that resulted in larger than expected pro-

296  |  Chapter 7

jected reductions in the deficit. Indeed, as the President and Congress
worked toward a 5-year balanced budget deal in the spring of 1997, the
Congressional Budget Office (CBO) announced that it was reducing its
5-year deficit projection by another $225 billion. Over the entire period
between 1994 and 2000, actual budget outcomes were about $2.6 trillion
better than those projected by the CBO in 1993, with CBO’s estimates
showing that stronger than expected economic conditions accounted for
about 38 percent of this improvement with policy changes accounting
for another 25 percent. Since CBO’s estimates did not include the effects
of these policy changes on aggregate economic performance, its estimate
of their contribution to the improving budgetary outlook should be
interpreted as a lower bound estimate of their actual effects.1
An economic boom that far exceeded forecasts was a major factor
behind the remarkable budgetary improvement. But what explains the
economy’s extraordinary performance—a growth rate in excess of 3.8%,
a labor productivity growth rate at 3%, nearly double the 1975-1995
rate, and an unemployment rate falling to 4% with low inflation at
2.6%—a combination of macroeconomic outcomes unfathomable when
President Clinton took office? And what was the role of his policies in
fostering this performance?
The most important economic variable underlying budget outcomes is the rate of growth, and a key volatile and unpredictable driver of
economic growth is the productivity growth rate. In standard economic
models, there are two main sources of labor productivity growth—capital deepening and technological progress. Both were in overdrive in the
late 1990s.
As the 1995 Economic Report pointed out, there is a strong correlation between investment rates and labor productivity growth across
industrial countries, and business investment soared in the US during
the 1995-2000 period. President Clinton’s fiscal policies were premised
on an untested theory that a credible sustained reduction in the budget
deficit would increase national savings, resulting in a significant decline
in long-term interest rates that in turn would boost investment spending. The economy’s performance during the second half of the 1990s
was consistent with the theory’s predictions: as the projected borrowing
needs of the Federal Government declined, national savings increased,
and long-term interest rates continued their gradual decline. Lower borrowing costs in turn fuelled stronger investment spending.

But this was only part of the story. The boom in information
technology along with the resulting lower cost of computers and IT
capital also fed the surge in business investment as did the soaring stock
market.2 As the anticipated productivity benefits of the 50-year old computer revolution began to intensify and spread throughout the economy,
businesses were motivated to invest to reap these benefits.
The economy also benefitted from other unpredicted and unpredictable positive supply shocks, including a deceleration in health care
costs in 1994-1995, moderate wage settlements, falling oil prices, and
a soaring dollar. All of these beneficial developments ameliorated the
predicted tradeoff between strong growth and low unemployment on the
one hand and low inflation on the other.
As a result, the Federal Reserve—whose independence was
staunchly defended by the Clinton economic team—was able to pursue
a monetary policy that focused on the growth side of its dual mandate.
Indeed, Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan often mentioned positive
productivity surprises in his explanation of Fed policy during the second
half of the 1990s. And consistent with economic theory, the combination
of tighter fiscal policy and relatively easy monetary policy held down
real interest rates and created a macroeconomic climate that supported a
growth-enhancing investment boom.
I have met former President Clinton many times since 2001 when
his term of office ended. With a touch of humor, he often reminds me
that as CEA Chair I provided forecasts that significantly underestimated
the economy’s macro performance. I humbly respond that I was simply
providing unbiased forecasts based on the prevailing consensus among
economists, a consensus that was proven wrong. I also remind him that
as an economic forecaster and policy-maker it is wise to err on the side
of caution.

policy. By the early 1980s, the focus on macroeconomic stabilization policy
had shifted to the Federal Reserve, and the economics profession had come
to see a smaller role for discretionary countercyclical fiscal policy. However,
this has changed again in recent years, as the length and severity of the Great
Recession and its aftermath have precipitated a resurgence of interest in
discretionary fiscal policy.
In addition, the Federal Government now plays a larger regulatory
role in areas including health care, the environment, and labor markets than
it did when CEA was first formed—a time before the establishment of, for
298  |  Chapter 7

example, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Health
and Human Services, the Department of Transportation, the Department
of Education, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. At
the same time, the field of economics has broadened to include not only
traditional areas like macroeconomics and finance, but also subjects such as
health care and the environment. As a result, a considerably larger fraction
of CEA’s work today is devoted to analyzing regulatory issues in areas like
health, labor, and the environment than during its early years.
Despite the evolution in CEA’s institutional structure and policy
priorities over the years, CEA has continued to fulfill its functions under the
Employment Act, which—as outlined above—can be understood as being
organized around four interconnected functions: (1) helping to develop economic policy; (2) helping to advance the President’s economic agenda; (3)
gathering, analyzing, and interpreting information on economic trends and
developments; and (4) engaging with the economics community. Of course,
these functions overlap to some extent—for example, monitoring economic
trends and engaging the economics community help to inform the formulation of economic policies. Yet examining how CEA has fulfilled these four
functions over the course of its history is useful both for understanding how
its work supports the President, and for illustrating certain characteristics
which have helped to render it a more effective and durable institution.

Help to Develop Economic Policy
The Employment Act provides that CEA shall “develop and recommend to the President national economic policies to foster and promote free
competitive enterprise, to avoid economic fluctuations or to diminish the
effects thereof, and to maintain employment, production, and purchasing
power.” CEA performs many different tasks to fulfill this function, including
working collaboratively with other offices and agencies to develop legislative
proposals (such as the President’s Budget and State of the Union initiatives),
providing analysis to support regulatory processes, and supporting other
administrative initiatives.
Although the Employment Act signaled that the Federal Government
would be held responsible for how the economy functioned, its language
reflected a careful balance between supporting macroeconomic management as well as a less active approach to the business cycle. As a result, CEA
is not tied to one macroeconomic philosophy, but instead has “march[ed]
alternately under these two banners” over the course of its history (Hargrove
and Morley 1984).

The 70th Anniversary of the Council of Economic Advisers  |  299

The perspective of CEA has varied depending on the ideology of
different administrations, the particular people chosen as chair, members
and staff of the Council, the understanding of the economics profession
more broadly, and the specific economic circumstances facing the country.
However, CEA has consistently advanced a perspective that emphasizes the
importance of decentralized decisions to the effective functioning of our
market economy, but which also recognizes that the Federal Government
has an important role in macroeconomic stabilization, in correcting market
failures, and in ensuring that everyone participates sufficiently in the economy’s benefits. Indeed, the Council’s very first Report rejected both complete
laissez-faire and overreliance on fiscal and monetary remedies as approaches
to macroeconomic policy, denoting these two positions, respectively, as the
“Spartan Doctrine of Laissez Faire” and the “Roman Doctrine of an External
Remedy” (CEA 1946).

Keyserling and “Full-Employment Economics”
Perhaps the closest CEA has ever come to endorsing the “Roman”
view was during the Truman Administration, when CEA was chaired by
Leon Keyserling, the second person to hold that position. Before becoming
CEA chairman, Keyserling had served as vice chairman of CEA and had
previously worked as a legislative assistant on Capitol Hill, where he helped
author, among other things, the Employment Act of 1946. Keyserling was
influenced by proto-Keynesian theories, and became a major advocate of
“full-employment economics—harnessing government spending to foster
employment by creating demand and promoting consumer spending”
(Wehrle 2004). Keyserling believed, “despite the grim experience of the
1930s, that the potential of the American economy was unlimited, and that
with the proper combination of countercyclical and long-term economic
policy, economic growth could produce and maintain abundance for all”
(Brazelton 1997).
Unable to find political support for dramatically expanding domestic
social programs, an increasingly frustrated Keyserling turned to defense
spending as a means to advance his full-employment agenda. After Russia
detonated an atomic bomb in August 1949, President Truman ordered
that the State and Defense departments conduct a review of the national
security situation and develop a planning document, which eventually
became known as NSC 68. When war broke out in Korea, the Truman
Administration definitively committed to the rapid mobilization of military
resources called for in NSC 68.
While Keyserling was not a central figure in directing the mobilization effort, he actively promoted it and defended its economic viability.
300  |  Chapter 7

Keyserling and the Council participated in the National Security Council’s
so-called “costing exercise” to estimate the cost of the military mobilization. CEA also helped to draft the economics chapter of NSC 68, and CEA
defended the economic feasibility of a massive defense expansion against
the view—held by the Secretary of Defense and the Budget Director—that
it would precipitate “ruinous inflation, intolerable economic dislocation, or
both” (Flash 1965). Keyserling also helped to forestall the implementation
of direct price controls, believing they would dampen expanded production.
In doing all of this, the Council helped to persuade policymakers that the
Truman Administration’s national security objectives were compatible with
its economic ones.
For a few years, Keyserling successfully used the Korean War mobilization to promote his expansionist agenda. During the war, unemployment
fell below 4 percent, and labor leaders appointed by Truman to various planning agencies helped to redirect some military spending to economically
depressed regions and industries in the United States (Wehrle 2004).
By the end of the Korean War, however, Keyserling’s influence, and
support for his policies, had diminished. As inflation began to mount, the
Council found itself torn between competing objectives: Keyserling warned
the President about inflationary pressure, yet he also worried that excessive
focus on inflation would be used as a pretext to dampen spending. This
ambivalence served to exacerbate confusion within the administration about
the proper course of action, and in turn, undercut the Council’s influence
toward the end of the Truman Presidency (Flash 1965).

The Heller Council and the 1964 Tax Cut
Another particularly notable instance where CEA played a large role
in advocating for countercyclical policy occurred during the Kennedy and
Johnson Administrations. In the early months of Kennedy’s Presidency,
unemployment had reached almost 7 percent and economic growth had
been lackluster. Two schools of thought developed on the source of the
problem: the first group, which included CEA Chairman Walter Heller,
argued that the problem was insufficient aggregate demand, and that public
spending or tax reductions were necessary to boost demand for goods and
services; by contrast, the second group argued that there were structural
deficiencies in the economy, and that increasing spending would only aggravate the problem (Norton 1977).
Drawing on relatively new macroeconomic concepts such as the fiscal
multiplier and the full employment surplus, CEA made the case that the
economy suffered from insufficient demand, emphasizing “the gap between
progress and potential, the resistance to improvement of unemployment,
The 70th Anniversary of the Council of Economic Advisers  |  301

and the drag of the wartime tax structure” (Flash 1965). The Council presented its argument publicly on several occasions: before the Joint Economic
Committee in 1961, and in the 1962 and 1963 Economic Report of the
President. In the 1963 Economic Report, the Council strongly advocated for
a tax cut to boost demand:
[F]or all its advances, the Nation is still falling substantially short
of its economic potential … Private initiative and public policy
must join hands to break the barriers built up by the years of slack
since 1957 and bring the Nation into a new period of sustained full
employment and rapid economic growth … The main block to full
employment is an unrealistically heavy burden of taxation. The time
has come to remove it.
Through these efforts, CEA helped solidify support for the tax reduction. President John F. Kennedy pushed for it in his 1963 State of the Union
address, and it was ultimately signed into law by President Lyndon B.
Johnson in 1964. CEA did not design the specific details of the tax reduction,
but it helped to make the supporting economic case.
Edward Flash, a scholar of public administration, argues that this
moment constituted a turning point in the Council’s history by helping to
align economic policymaking with economic thinking at that time:
As demonstrated by the Administration’s tax program, the primary
significance of the Heller Council is that it was the most important
single creative force in the development of a new approach to economic policy. As the Employment Act of 1946 ratified the government’s responsibility for the nation’s economic welfare (and hence
its acceptance of Keynesian principles), the tax proposals of 1963 signaled the policy-maker’s recognition that expenditure-revenue combinations leading to deficits can be a constructive force in economic
growth. Policy thinking became more consistent with economic
thinking. A new tradition was established. The Council analyzed,
advocated, articulated, and gained acceptance for new economic
values, new techniques of economic analysis, and new concepts of
fiscal policy as a positive contributor to national economic well-being
(1965).
Moreover, Flash notes that winning President Kennedy’s approval for
implementing countercyclical policy at a time of existing budget deficits was
a notable achievement, especially considering that the President had previously committed himself to balancing the Federal budget.

302  |  Chapter 7

Countercyclical Policy in Other Administrations
CEA has engaged in deliberations about countercyclical fiscal policy
at some point during most administrations in the post-World War II era.
As discussed later, CEA Chairman Arthur F. Burns helped to convince
President Dwight D. Eisenhower to support counter-recessionary tax cuts,
“the first time massive tax cuts were made at a time of Federal budgetary
deficit to counter a recession” (Norton 1977). The Gardner Ackley CEA
tried but failed to convince President Johnson to raise taxes in 1965 to
avoid inflation. The Alan Greenspan CEA advocated for, and the Ford
Administration proposed, a fiscal stimulus in 1975 that was considerably
more moderate than what was ultimately enacted by Congress, and called
for “greater fiscal restraint” in the 1976 Economic Report (CEA 1976). The
Schultze CEA advocated for an additional stimulus in 1977 during the Carter
Administration (Schultze 1996), while the Michael J. Boskin CEA advocated
for set of tax measures to stimulate the economy during the George H.W.
Bush Administration (Frankel 2003). The Laura D. Tyson CEA advocated
for a small one-time expenditure stimulus as part of a larger deficit reduction program during the Clinton Administration. The R. Glenn Hubbard,
N. Gregory Mankiw, and Harvey S. Rosen CEAs promoted tax cuts enacted
in 2001 and 2003 as a means of stimulating the economy during a period of
sluggish economic activity (CEA 2002; CEA 2004; Rosen and Forbes 2005).
Most recently, under the leadership of CEA Chairs Edward Lazear,
Christina Romer, and Austan Goolsbee, CEA played a role in designing
countercyclical measures that were passed in response to the 2008-09
global financial crisis and its aftermath. The Council conducted the overall
macroeconomic analysis that helped identify the need for, and design of,
countercyclical fiscal measures, most notably the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009 (see Box 7-2 for former CEA Chair Christina
Romer’s account of the role that CEA played in the Obama Administration’s
response to the financial crisis).
CEA has also pushed to defend existing automatic stabilizers—features of the tax and transfer system that automatically offset fluctuations
in economic activity—against policy changes, such as balanced-budget
proposals, that would interfere with them. Charles Schultze observes that
“[w]hile most Republican CEAs throughout the period continued to be
more cautious than their Democratic counterparts about the advice they
gave on the use of fiscal policy for stabilization purposes, the difference was
one of degree, not of kind” (1996).

Box 7-2: Former CEA Chair Christina Romer (2009 – 2010)
President Obama was elected in the middle of the severe financial
crisis in November 2008. Even with incomplete data and rapidly changing conditions, it was clear at the time that the crisis was having a rapid
and disastrous impact on the rest of the economy. Firms unable to get
loans were laying off workers, consumers were deserting stores, and
unemployed families were struggling to keep their homes.
Because of the crisis, the incoming economics team had to start
designing many of the policy responses during the transition—before we
had the resources or the skills of the professional staffs at our agencies.
That was certainly true of the fiscal stimulus package that the President
worked closely with Congress to craft, and which was signed into law as
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act less than a month after his
inauguration. From late November on, the economics team debated and
planned a package of tax cuts, infrastructure spending, and aid to those
directly affected by the crisis to try to help stabilize the economy and
make it stronger in the future.
Though we were a skeletal team—just the member nominees and
two graduate students who would eventually become staff economists—
the transition Council of Economic Advisers attempted to do what CEA
always does: bring the best evidence and economic analysis to bear on
the problem. We gathered economic projections from a wide range of
public- and private-sector forecasters. In the spirit of bipartisan professionalism that has always characterized CEA, the outgoing chair, Edward
Lazear, and his staff shared the evidence they had about the economy
and where it was heading. We also collected the best estimates available
of the likely effects of different types of fiscal actions from the economics
literature, professional agencies such as the Federal Reserve, and private
forecasters.
As we put the forecasts and the estimates of the effects of fiscal
stimulus together, it quickly became apparent that the fiscal packages
being considered by most analysts and Congress were too small. This was
a once-in-a-century problem that required a once-in-a-century response.
The analysis we presented to the President-Elect in mid-December 2008
helped persuade him to work with Congress for a larger, more effective package. Though the final legislation was still not has large as the
President would have desired given the terrible recession, at $787 billion,
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act was by far the largest
discretionary fiscal stimulus in American history. And a burgeoning
literature on its effects confirms that the Act was essential in helping to
halt the decline and turn the economy around.

304  |  Chapter 7

In designing the Recovery Act, one component around which
there was substantial uncertainty was aid to State and local governments.
Rising unemployment was devastating state tax revenues, and economists feared that state balanced-budget requirements would force State
and local governments to cut spending and employment just as their
economies and citizens needed those funds and jobs the most. For this
reason, the incoming economics team urged Congress to include in the
Recovery Act transfers from the Federal Government to the States to stabilize their coffers. As a practical matter, this was accomplished primarily
by temporarily increasing the fraction of Medicaid spending (always a
joint Federal/State program) covered by the Federal Government. The
final Recovery Act included roughly $140 billion of state fiscal relief of
this and other sorts.
Though the logic of the action was sound, because such fiscal
transfers are rare there was only limited empirical evidence on their
likely effects. CEA helped fill that knowledge gap by doing a careful
study of the state fiscal relief done through the Recovery Act. The study,
conducted by four CEA staff economists, was included in CEA’s first
quarterly report to Congress on the effects of the Recovery Act. CEA
economists used the fact that some of the variation in the fiscal relief
across States was due to pre-existing differences in the generosity of
their Medicaid programs, rather than to state economic conditions, to
accurately identify the employment effects of these transfers. The estimates indicated that the effects were substantial. Indeed, the estimated
job effects were sufficiently large that the state fiscal relief appeared to
be one of the most cost-effective components of the legislation. The four
economists ultimately expanded their study into a paper, which was
published in the American Economic Journal: Economic Policy (where it
won the best paper prize in 2013).1
This CEA analysis of state fiscal relief was influential in subsequent
policy discussions and recommendations. Though the American economy started growing again in the summer of 2009, job losses continued
throughout the year and unemployment remained painfully high. The
economics team debated at length the relative merits of many measures
to spur job growth. Interestingly, about the only thing we didn’t debate
was the desirability of additional state fiscal relief. What had been a logical but untested action in the Recovery Act was now understood to have
been an effective job-creation tool—thanks in part to CEA’s analysis.
There was easy agreement that it belonged in any second comprehensive

jobs package. And in early December 2009, President Obama proposed
additional action, which included further funds for State and local governments as a significant part.
Sadly, Congress did not accept all of the President’s recommendations, and fewer additional job creation measures were taken that winter
than were needed. But additional state fiscal relief resurfaced in a more
limited form in a bill the President signed on August 10, 2010. As part of
a multi-faceted act, Congress appropriated $10 billion in aid to State and
local governments to help maintain teacher jobs. A treasured memento
of my time at CEA is one of the pens the President used to sign that bill.
It is a reminder that rigorous empirical analysis by one of the smallest
agencies in Washington can sometimes spur legislation that creates jobs
and helps heal a troubled economy.

Microeconomic Policy
In recent decades, CEA has increasingly spent its time applying core
microeconomic lessons: that individuals and organizations’ behavior is
shaped by the incentives they face; that markets are generally an efficient
way of organizing economic activity; that public policy can sometimes
improve the functioning of markets, such as in the presence of externalities
(when the market does not fully take social costs and benefits into account)
or informational problems; and that policy choices can affect whether the
benefits of markets are narrowly or broadly shared. Schultze writes that “the
injection of basic microeconomic principles, well back from the frontiers of
research, can significantly raise the quality of the debate” (1996).
Although CEA’s views on some particular microeconomic issues have
evolved over time and with administrations, this shared commitment to a
basic microeconomic canon has ensured a substantial amount of continuity. Under both Republican and Democratic administrations, the Council
has argued that reshaping incentives is often a better way of addressing
market failures than imposing command-and-control regulation. It has also
pushed for policies that promote overall economic efficiency, rather than
the well-being of specific sectors, industries, or firms. Charles Schultze notes
that “despite some areas of disagreement, a succession of CEAs under both
parties has given similar advice on a wide range of microeconomic matters”
(1996).
CEA has also frequently provided more detailed technical or empirical
expertise, such as analyzing the effect of policies on incentives or performing
cost-benefit analyses. Former CEA Chairman Joseph Stiglitz enumerates a
number of specific “narrow microeconomic initiatives” in which CEA has
played an important role, such as designing tradable permits in pollutants,
306  |  Chapter 7

incorporating risk and discounting into cost-benefit analysis, and introducing auction mechanisms (1997). During negotiations over the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990, CEA was viewed as the “repository of neutral competence” and was called on to produce unbiased cost estimates of a range
of different provisions (Porter 1997). In recent years, empirical research
has become an especially important part of CEA’s portfolio, reflecting the
proliferation of available data and the economics profession’s shift toward
empirical work. This trend has benefited the field of microeconomics in
particular (Stevenson 2014).
CEA has also helped to advocate for, or contribute to, the generation of
new policy proposals. For example, the Burns Council supported the Federal
Aid Highway Act of 1954, which began the present Interstate Highway
System. The Heller Council under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson was
especially prolific, “helping to shape transportation and trade bills, aiding
in the development of the monetary ‘twist’ policy, helping to keep mortgage
rates down, [and] developing the rationale of the wage-price guideposts”
(Flash 1965). It also helped to develop the idea of the War on Poverty.3 Other
CEAs have helped to initiate or push for (sometimes successfully; sometimes
not) various other reforms, such spectrum auctions, pension simplification
and indexed bonds, reforms of the air-traffic control system, housing sector
reform, and a comprehensive approach to natural-disaster policy (Stiglitz
1997). During the negotiations over the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change,
former CEA Chair Janet Yellen testified on a number of occasions regarding the cost savings that could be achieved through emissions trading and
participation by developing countries (Hahn and Stavins 2002). (See Box
7-3 for former CEA Chairman N. Gregory Mankiw’s description of CEA’s
role in trying to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the George W.
Bush Administration.)
3 Walter Heller gives the following account of the impetus for the War on Poverty: “Then
around Christmas of 1962, [President Kennedy] read Dwight MacDonald’s poverty articles
in the New Yorker that helped get him started. Then he asked to see some other things that
had been written… He asked to see these things, read them and was obviously deeply affected
… So first of all I had Bob [Lampman] put together the things he had done—the best work
on the subject in the United States—namely measuring what had happened to poverty, what
the sources of poverty were, what groups were impacted, why people were mired in poverty.
We gave Kennedy this factual account about in March of 1963. Then something triggered my
political interest in it: in June it was said that some Republican group—I’ve forgotten which
Republican policy committee—was going to zero in on the poverty problem. At that point
I wrote my basic memo to Kennedy saying in effect, ‘You really should have in your 1964
program an attack—(I didn’t call it a war on poverty, but an attack)—on poverty, and here are
the kinds of things that it might include. Unless you tell us not to, we’re going to go ahead and
work on them.’ We worked on them through the summer and—this, I think is well known—
the very last thing I talked to him about—three days before the assassination—was the poverty
program, and he said, ‘It’s going to be part of my program.’ We didn’t know how big it was to
be” (Hargrove and Morley 1984).

The 70th Anniversary of the Council of Economic Advisers  |  307

Box 7-3: Former CEA Chairman N. Gregory Mankiw (2003 – 2005)
Looking back at my experience as CEA chair, I am struck by the
broad range of questions the Council had to confront. Should corporate
dividends be taxed at the same rate as ordinary income? What effect
does Chinese exchange-rate policy have on the American economy?
How should accountants treat executive stock options when computing
a company’s earnings? Why aren’t U.S. utilities building new nuclear
power plants? How should “means” be defined when means-testing a
Medicare entitlement? What is the best way for policymakers to help
speed the nascent recovery from the dot-com collapse?
For a professional economist, working at CEA is both demanding
and exhilarating. Confronting such a large range of issues is inevitably a
learning experience—and one done in short order and with high stakes.
It is a great honor to play a small part in trying to steer public policy in
a better direction and thereby improve the lives of our fellow citizens.
With the benefit of hindsight, one issue from my time at CEA is
particularly notable: the oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. CEA
was part of a White House team that tried to reform these governmentsponsored enterprises (GSEs). We recognized that the GSEs were problematic. Their private goal of profit maximization did not mesh well with
the implicit government guarantee of their debts.
In a speech I gave in November 2003 to a conference of bank supervisors, I described the situation as follows: “The enormous size of the
mortgage-backed securities market means that any problems at the GSEs
matter for the financial system as a whole. This risk is a systemic issue
also because the debt obligations of the housing GSEs are widely held by
other financial institutions. The importance of GSE debt in the portfolios
of other financial entities means that even a small mistake in GSE risk
management could have ripple effects throughout the financial system.”
The administration sought legislation that would create and
empower a more effective regulator. The regulator would have the
authority to set both risk-based and minimum capital standards for
GSEs; to review and, if appropriate, reject new GSE activities; and to
wind down the affairs of a troubled GSE through receivership. We also
wanted to make the GSEs less political. We recommended removing
presidentially appointed directors from their boards and giving the
regulator a permanent funding mechanism by allowing it to assess the
GSEs rather than relying on the congressional appropriations process.
In the end, the administration failed in this effort, at least while I
was there. Legislation to improve the oversight of Fannie and Freddie
was enacted only in July 2008, well after the imbalances that led to the
2007-08 financial crisis had built up, making the problems apparent to
everyone. In 2003 and 2004, with financial markets still placid, Fannie
308  |  Chapter 7

and Freddie had lots of friends in Congress (on both sides of the aisle)
who blocked the White House’s reform efforts. But we fought the good
fight. And subsequent history shows, I believe, that we were on the right
side of the issue.
Did CEA at the time foresee the housing boom and bust that
unfolded over the next six years? No, of course not. But we did recognize
the vulnerabilities of the GSEs, which were major players in the huge
market for mortgage-backed securities. Would the proposed reforms
have prevented the financial crisis? No, probably not. But they might
have made it less severe and more manageable.
People often ask me whether it is frustrating to work in Washington,
noting how hard it is to get anything done. Yes, in some ways, it is. This
episode is only one example where our good policy (as my White House
colleagues and I saw it) was subverted by an uncooperative legislature.
Yet, over time, I have come to appreciate that frustration for those
in policy jobs is not a bug in the system but rather a feature. The founding fathers, in their great wisdom, built this tension into the system. In
high school civics classes, it goes by the name “checks and balances.”
A common lament is that there is too much gridlock in Washington,
and maybe there is. But imagine that your least favorite candidate wins
the next presidential election. Might you be grateful when the new
President and his or her CEA chair become frustrated while trying to
implement their new ideas for economic policy?

Ensuring that Policies are in the Public Interest
CEA also plays an important role in providing analyses to demonstrate that some policies, while superficially appealing or offering substantial
benefits to particular sectors or firms, are not cost-effective or in the national
interest. Joseph Stiglitz claims that “the money saved from just one of the
many bad projects the CEA had helped stop … would have been enough to
provide us with a permanent endowment” (1997). Former CEA Chairman
Ben Bernanke also emphasized this function when describing economists’
role in policymaking more generally, while at the same time emphasizing
the limitations of economics:
Economics is a highly sophisticated field of thought that is superb at
explaining to policymakers precisely why the choices they made in the
past were wrong. About the future, not so much. However, careful
economic analysis does have one important benefit, which is that it
can help kill ideas that are completely logically inconsistent or wildly
at variance with the data. This insight covers at least 90 percent of
proposed economic policies (2013).

Box 7-4: Former CEA Chairman Joseph Stiglitz (1995 – 1997)
My four years at the Council (two as a member and two as chairman) were perhaps the most memorable in my life. There were many
battles—some which we won, some which we lost, some in which we
achieved a temporary victory, and some which we lost in the short run
only to see our positions vindicated with time. We came into government at an exciting time. The fall of the Iron Curtain had redefined the
economic agenda. Our challenge was to find the right balance between
the market and the state. The Council saw its role as helping to clarify
the principles, and then applying these principles to the major issues of
the day.
The Council of Economic Advisers had an important positive
agenda, as we pushed to reshape trade, welfare, and environmental policies. To name one example, we successfully pushed for inflation indexed
bonds, arguing that they could provide retirees with insurance against
inflation—which they could not obtain in other ways—and that the
risk premium that the market would likely pay for these bonds would
generate revenues, important then as now in the context of budgetary
constraints. Some opposed inflation indexed bonds, ostensibly because
there would be little demand for them but perhaps grounded in the fact
that the low turnover on such bonds meant they would generate few fees
for Wall Street. Our view that there would be demand was vindicated
and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) have proven to be a
durable, useful, and informative part of the financial landscape.
Some of the most intense battles we fought now seem dated, and
that may have been partly because of our success. Today, there is a broad
consensus against “corporate welfare”—and especially tax expenditures
that both distort the economy and increase inequality, even if they have
shown enormous resilience. At the time, the topic was politically sensitive, but we drew up a list of them for the President, and that list has only
gotten longer with time.
But we also did a lot to stop bad ideas and in collaboration with
many allies across government, we succeeded in many arenas. We forged
an alliance with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice to
block a proposal to sustain the price of aluminum through the creation
of a global aluminum cartel. We helped overcome legislative attempts to
change the mandate of the Federal Reserve to focus only on inflation and
not on unemployment, and helped defeat a constitutional amendment to
require a balanced budget.
One temporary victory contains important lessons for CEA’s
commitment to understanding incentives. For years, we succeeded in
blocking the privatization of the United States Enrichment Corporation

310  |  Chapter 7

(USEC). USEC was responsible for producing and marketing enriched
uranium, the key ingredient in nuclear power plants and in atomic
bombs. CEA argued that private incentives to create markets for
USEC’s product conflicted with national and global interests in nonproliferation. Even worse, USEC was entrusted with bringing into the
United States the enriched uranium from deactivated Russian warheads.
We worried that USEC’s profit-making incentives would induce them
to do what they could to avoid bringing the uranium into the United
States. CEA’s concerns proved justified, as we uncovered that USEC had
refused an offer to buy substantial amounts of uranium from Russia.
This discovery halted the privatization, albeit only temporarily. But
USEC’s continued travails—leading even to proposals for renationalization—vindicated CEA’s position.
The Council was also engaged in other international issues. We
opposed the policy of Chinese containment that was pursued in the
earliest days of the Clinton Administration, and when the administration
changed course toward re-engagement, we became active participants
in that process. Our expertise in the transition from Communism to
a market economy, especially in Russia, gave us a seat at the table in
discussions over policies in that part of the world.
The Council was actively engaged in trade policy, not just pushing back against protectionist measures but defining the principles that
should guide market access initiatives. We questioned unfettered capital
flows across borders, a view that has become “officially” vindicated by
the IMF’s endorsement of it.
As I think back over the years at the Council, one of the things
that is striking is how many of the issues we focused on then have since
risen to the top of the agenda. One was climate change. The Council
was actively engaged in thinking about economic strategies that would
reduce our emissions and those of the rest of the world. I served on the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (which shared the 2007
Nobel Peace Prize with former Vice President Al Gore).
Another was inequality. We debated the causes and what could
be done about it, and included a full chapter on the topic in the 1997
Economic Report of the President. Our analysis highlighted how reducing
capital gains tax rates would enhance the country’s already worsening
inequality and further distort the economy.
As we engaged in these discussions and many more, CEA developed an enormously strong sense of comradery. It was these bonds as
much as the ideas themselves that I think about when I reflect upon my
four years at the Council.

The 70th Anniversary of the Council of Economic Advisers  |  311

There were many lessons that I draw from these and a multitude
of other examples during my four years in the Council. The Council
can stop bad ideas and initiate goods ones. Given its small—but highly
dedicated—staff, it must be focused and use leverage. It is most effective
when it works closely with other agencies, at multiple levels—interacting
both with staff and top political appointees. This is even truer today, with
an increasingly large number of departments having a chief economist.
Not to sound too imperial, but economics and economic analysis enter
into every aspect of public decision-making. Incentives matter. And this
is true not just in the arena of domestic policy, but also foreign policy.
Finally, most of the important issues are long run—whatever we do
today, we will be dealing with them for years to come. The Council can
play an important role in shaping, and elevating, the public debate.
As I wrote 20 years ago in celebration of the Council’s 50th
anniversary,1 CEA is an important institutional innovation that has
served the country well. Like other agencies in government, it has a
“special interest,” one that often gets short shrift in day-to-day political
life: the national interest.
1 Joseph Stiglitz. 1997. “Looking Out for the National Interest: The Principles of the Council
of Economic Advisers.” American Economic Review 87 (2): 109-113.

Some examples of this function are especially noteworthy (see Box 7 -4
for former CEA Chairman Joseph Stiglitz’s account of CEA’s role in evaluating and generating policy proposals during the Clinton Administration). For
instance, the Heller Council argued against a proposal during the Kennedy
Administration to use nuclear explosives to widen the Panama Canal. In the
Nixon Administration, CEA played a leading role in the analysis that led to
the conclusion that the government should not subsidize the development
of a supersonic transport or SST plane, dubbed the “sure-to-be-subsidized
transport” (Schultze 1996). Under President Ronald Reagan, CEA participated in a Gold Commission, which investigated the feasibility of returning
to the gold standard, and ultimately advised against doing so.
Of course, the President makes policy decisions based on a wide range
of other advice and perspectives, and economic considerations often are not
paramount. Furthermore, as former CEA Chairman Herbert Stein points
out, not all policy proposals lend themselves to such definitive economic
conclusions:
The range of uncertainty [in economics] has been very great and the
range of disagreements among respected people is very great. The
political figure making a decision has this great range from which to
choose, and he has to make a choice on some basis other than what
312  |  Chapter 7

can be reported to him as the perceived wisdom of the economics
profession because that perceived wisdom gives pretty wide range
(Hargrove and Morley 1984).
Finally, economic advice is only useful to policymakers if it is communicated well. Former CEA Chairman Martin Baily emphasizes that when
CEA is assessing proposals from Congress or other parts of the administration, it is important for it “to frame those issues in a way that can help foster
useful discussion among policymakers” (2006).

Help to Advance the President’s Economic Agenda
Another primary function of CEA is to help advance the President’s
economic agenda. As outlined in CEA’s 1961 statement before the Joint
Economic Committee, “[t]he Council has a responsibility to explain to the
Congress and to the public the general economic strategy of the President’s
program, especially as it relates to the objectives of the Employment Act.”
CEA accomplishes this through several different means: writing the annual
Economic Report of the President and testifying before the Joint Economic
Committee, producing reports on specific policy proposals or issues, delivering speeches, writing op-eds, speaking with reporters, and in more recent
years, writing blog posts and engaging the public on social media outlets.
Despite the fact that CEA draws heavily from academia and performs
economic research, it is not an academic institution or an independent
body. Instead, CEA is part of the team that helps to develop the President’s
agenda—and its public communications are intended to complement that
role, while reflecting rigorous economic research. Like communications
from any other component of the Executive Office of the President or the
administration more generally, statements from CEA are intended to be
consistent with the President’s agenda and economic policy.
As many commentators and former CEA chairs have observed, there
can be a tension between CEA’s duty to advance the President’s agenda
and its responsibility to provide expert economic advice. For most of its
history, CEA has managed to strike a successful balance between these
roles. As Edward Flash notes, CEA’s reports are “not … partisan tracts
but rather documents oriented to the economic policies and values of the
Administration” (1965). However, there are inherent challenges entailed by
fulfilling these dual responsibilities. This section uses the conflict between
CEA’s first chairman, Edwin G. Nourse, and its second, Leon H. Keyserling,
to explore these challenges. It also draws some institutional lessons to ensure
the Council’s continued effectiveness.

The 70th Anniversary of the Council of Economic Advisers  |  313

Nourse and Keyserling
The three years (1946-49) during which Nourse and Keyserling served
on the Council together were difficult ones. Nourse opposed Keyserling’s
“full-employment economics” and expansionist agenda, and held different
views than Keyserling on inflation and countercyclical policy. Their disagreements on economic policy were exacerbated by ambiguity surrounding
the Council’s organizational structure. Although Nourse was the official
chairman, he and the two members had functionally equivalent roles and
responsibilities, and each of them got one vote when making decisions.
Consequently, it was not always clear who was speaking on behalf of the
Council, and Edward Flash reports that by 1948, “the Council could no
longer report to the President in a single voice, as memoranda and reports
began to incorporate differing individual viewpoints” (1965).
Nourse and Keyserling also held fundamentally different views about
how the Council should operate. Nourse, who had enjoyed a distinguished
career as an agricultural economist, viewed the Council as a “scientific
agency” that should be objective and scrupulously avoid politics. Nourse
summarized his view of the Council in a letter to President Truman accepting the offer of chairmanship:
The Council of Economic Advisers is conceived as a scientific
agency of the Federal Government. Its prime function is to bring the
best available methods of social science to the service of the Chief
Executive and of the Congress in formulating national policy from
year to year and from month to month. There is no occasion for the
Council to become involved in any way in the advocacy of particular
measures or in the rival beliefs and struggles of the different economic and political interest groups. It should give a clearer and more
comprehensive picture than we have ever had as to the economic
state of the nation, as to factors which are tending to retard prosperity, and as to the probable effect of various remedial measures which
may be under consideration by the Executive or the Congress (Flash
1965).	
Nourse believed that the Council’s function should be limited to providing advice, and did not view himself as “being an active participant in, or
advocate of, the President’s program, involved in day-to-day affairs, or in
the promotion of his program” (Norton 1977). Indeed, he took this notion
so seriously that he argued that members of the Council should not testify
before any Congressional committees other than appropriation committees.

314  |  Chapter 7

By contrast, Keyserling had actively engaged in public policy before
arriving at CEA: he had served as a legislative assistant to Senator Robert
Wagner and as a staff member of the Senate Committee on Banking and
Currency, worked in different capacities at various public housing agencies,
and participated in numerous Democratic election campaigns. He—and
to a lesser extent, CEA’s other member, John D. Clark—believed that the
Council should not only provide advice, but also should participate in the
policy process and advocate for the President’s policies. As discussed above,
for example, he did not hesitate to involve himself in the Korean War
mobilization, since it aligned with his views of the necessity of economic
expansion. In addition, he felt that the Council’s advice should not be limited to economics, and should include “social and political aspects” as well
(Norton 1977). Keyserling and Clark also thought it was entirely appropriate
for them to testify before Congressional committees. Ultimately, it became
necessary for President Truman to resolve the disagreement, siding with
Keyserling and Clark.
After three years of service as chairman of CEA, Nourse tendered his
resignation to President Truman. Nourse had become increasingly frustrated that he was “unable to develop satisfactory relations or channels of
communication with the President and the White House,” while Keyserling,
who was more “operationally and promotionally included than Nourse,”
had an easier time operating within a political environment (Flash 1965).
Keyserling was named chairman about six months after Nourse’s departure.
Although Keyserling outlasted Nourse, the acrimony between the
two men, along with the perception of Keyserling as being overly political,
contributed to questions about the Council’s future. Criticism began to
intensify toward the later part of the Truman Administration, and in 1949,
the Hoover Commission on Government Reorganization recommended
that CEA be replaced with an Office of the Economic Adviser that would
have a single head, but a similar staff (Nourse 1953).
Once Republicans won the White House and both houses of Congress
in 1952, the future status of the Council was unclear. Toward the end of
the Truman Administration, Congress cut the Council’s budget for fiscal year 1953 by 25 percent, but a group of Senators who supported the
Council managed to have its funds distributed so as to fully fund it for the
first nine months of the fiscal year (Flash 1965). Funds ran out on March
1, 1953, around six weeks after President Dwight D. Eisenhower took
office, by which time most of CEA’s staff had dispersed. The new Congress
refused President Eisenhower’s request to extend funds for the end of the
fiscal year, instead providing funding for a single economic assistant to the
President (Porter 1991). It was “widely believed at the time that the Council’s
The 70th Anniversary of the Council of Economic Advisers  |  315

shut-down towards the end of the Truman Administration was a result of
excess politicking under Keyserling’s chairmanship” (Naveh 1981), though
Keyserling himself disputed this perception.
Eventually, Arthur F. Burns, who had been appointed as President
Eisenhower’s sole economic adviser, convinced the President and Congress
to keep CEA, arguing that “the President definitely needed economic advice
on a continual basis and on a professional level … [and] that a deliberative body would serve the President better than a single economic adviser”
(Hargrove and Morley 1984). Congress restored CEA’s appropriation and
Burns was sworn in as chairman in March 1953.
Burns also helped to persuade President Eisenhower to reorganize
CEA. Together with staff from the Budget Bureau (the precursor to the
Office of Management and Budget), he worked to develop Reorganization
Plan No. 9, which formally established the chair as the leader of CEA, and
gave her or him responsibility for representing the Council to the President.
However, Hugh Norton writes that perhaps Burns’s greatest “contribution
was his success, at least in appearance, in removing the Council from the
area of partisanship into which it had fallen in the late Truman-Keyserling
period … To what degree this was merely an illusion is debatable, but at least
he created the image” (1977).

Institutional Lessons
The discord between Nourse and Keyserling and its political fall-out
illustrates that CEA chairs and members need to be able to operate effectively within a political environment without it affecting the integrity of
their economic advice. Put more succinctly, Charles Schultze advises that
“CEA members should see themselves as partisan advocates of the efficient
solution” (1996). Former CEA Chairman Murray Weidenbaum writes that
subsequent CEA chairs and members have “tried to avoid the two extremes
of the Truman Administration so as not to be pegged as either advocate or
oracle” (1996).
Political values and judgments intersect with CEA’s role in a number
of ways. As Schultze notes, CEA must have some political sensibilities to be
effective: “[t]he CEA chairman and members cannot be effective if they are
seen as political eunuchs, with little understanding of the political stakes
involved” (1996). Arthur Okun concurs, “[i]t is far more important for society and for the profession to have economists who maintain rapport with the
President and thus have the greatest influence on the inside” (Naveh 1981).
Similarly, former CEA Member William A. Niskanen recommends that
“[m]embers of the CEA, and other senior policy advisers, should be selected
on the basis of three criteria: professionalism, loyalty to the fundamental
316  |  Chapter 7

goals of the government in their area of responsibility, and an ability to operate in a political environment” (1986).
Moreover, although CEA’s strength is providing unvarnished economic advice, it is impossible to divorce this advice from the broader
context of the Administration’s goals and objectives. While economists can
help policymakers to weigh tradeoffs among different policy options or to
design policies so that they are more likely to achieve their stated objective,
how those tradeoffs are weighed and goals are set often depends on values.
In addition, policy recommendations themselves are more relevant if they
can be implemented, which in turn depends on a range of political factors
like legislative feasibility and how the policy is described and contextualized.
Finally, CEA chairs are selected and agree to serve because they at least
broadly share the goals and values of the President and the administration.
Beyond the chair, however, there is no guarantee that CEA members, or
especially staff economists and researchers, share a political or philosophical
agreement with the President.
As dictated in the Employment Act of 1946, CEA’s advice must ultimately be guided by its own analysis of which economic policies will foster
and promote free competitive enterprise, avoid economic fluctuations, and
maintain employment, production, and purchasing power. Former CEA
chairs, members, and staff offer several specific pieces of advice as to how
to successfully strike this balance: they advise that CEA should not publicly
advocate for policies that are not supported by economic analysis, and that
CEA should stick to giving economic advice, not political advice. CEA’s
comparative advantage is economics, and as illustrated by Keyserling’s
tenure and its aftermath, straying outside this function risks damaging the
institution’s credibility.
Others advise that the Council should not get too involved in policy
coordination. CEA’s limited staff and resources, combined with the academic background of most of its staff, render it poorly equipped to serve as
a policy coordinating body. One episode that illustrates this lesson occurred
during the Johnson Administration, when CEA was responsible for the
day-to-day administration of wage-price guideposts to combat inflation.
Reflecting on the experience, Walter Heller remarked that there was no
other appropriate agency to handle the wage-price guideposts, but that it
was “diversionary” and that “the Council has to stay away from that kind of
operational responsibility” (Hargrove and Morley 1984).
Excessive involvement in policy coordination can also have the effect
of undermining CEA’s institutional credibility, due to the types of compromises that are necessary. Hugh Norton writes that CEA’s efforts to administer the wage-price guidelines “had the effect of weakening the general moral
The 70th Anniversary of the Council of Economic Advisers  |  317

authority of the Council” (1977). Charles Schultze refused to move his office
from the Eisenhower Executive Office Building to the West Wing and serve
as an economic policy coordinator because “[h]e felt it would compromise
his objectivity and burden him with administrative duties inconsistent
with his role as the head of the President’s in-house economic think tank”
(Eizenstat 1992). Stuart Eizenstat, President Carter’s domestic policy adviser,
argues that “[t]he CEA cannot provide both detached, Olympian economic
advice and become enmeshed in the daily, inter-agency compromises and
political log-rolling” (1992).
This is not to say that CEA should not contribute to operational
matters at all. To the contrary, it is quite common for CEA to participate in
interagency committees, and CEA occasionally even chairs some committees. Yet the academic background of most of CEA’s staff and its mission to
provide expert economic advice, render it unsuited to serve as a policy or
strategic coordinator.
Recognizing this, most recent Presidents have relied on some other
institutional body or senior White House aides to coordinate economic
policy.4 Since 1993, the National Economic Council has been responsible
for coordinating economic policymaking. These arrangements have largely
served to augment CEA’s effectiveness by permitting it to focus on providing
economic advice and analysis and giving the Council greater exposure to the
President. Roger Porter writes:
What might appear on the surface as a competitive arrangement has
rarely been viewed by the participants as a zero-sum game. To the
contrary, both the CEA chairman and the White House economicpolicy assistant have usually viewed the other as an ally and often as
a trusted confidant (1997).
Former CEA Chairman Alan Krueger writes that the development
of the National Economic Council “elevated the Council of Economic
Advisers, freeing it to advocate efficient economic programs and ensuring
that the [P]resident had its input” (2000).

4 For example, President Eisenhower established the Advisory Board on Economic Growth and
Stability and the Council on Foreign Economic Policy; President Nixon created the Cabinet
Committee on Economic Policy, the Council on International Economic Policy, and the
Council on Economic Policy; President Ford established the Economic Policy Board; President
Carter created the Economic Policy Group; and President Reagan established the Economic
Policy Council. Most of these committees or councils have not continued in the same form
from one administration to the next (Orszag et al. 2002; Porter 1983).

318  |  Chapter 7

Gather, Analyze, and Interpret Information
on Economic Trends and Developments
Another one of CEA’s functions under the Employment Act of 1946
is to “to gather timely and authoritative information concerning economic
developments and economic trends.” This includes staying up to date on
major trends in the macroeconomy, financial markets, and labor markets,
as well as in sectors such as health care, energy, and housing. This role is
important not only because developments in these sectors can be the bases
for motivating future policies, but also because the President, senior White
House staff, and the public need to understand these issues.
CEA fulfills this role through a variety of different means, including:
sending regular memos to the President on the evening before key data
releases; providing daily, weekly, or monthly updates on developments in
the economy; writing more detailed one-off memos to the President and the
senior White House team on specific issues; producing public reports on relevant economic topics or trends; and publishing the annual Economic Report
of the President. Sometimes, the President will call for CEA to explicate a
particular issue. For example, Murray Weidenbaum reports having a “pleasant—but spirited and extended—difference of views [with President Ronald
Reagan] on the matter of seasonally adjusted versus unadjusted reports on
employment and unemployment” (1988). In many cases, this work does not
immediately motivate or advance a particular policy, but the ongoing monitoring and communicating information about the economy ultimately helps
to inform the development, prioritization, and public reception of economic
policies (see Box 7-5 for former CEA Chairman Alan Greenspan’s history of
the weekly Gross National Product measurement that CEA developed and
used to assess the need for expansionary fiscal measures during the Ford
Administration).

The Burns Council and the 1953-54 Recession
The 1953-54 recession represented an early test of this informationgathering function. By the time President Eisenhower took office in 1953,
the economy had fully recovered from a mild recession that had occurred a
few years earlier, and the unemployment rate was at its lowest point since
World War II. However, in July 1953, the United States signed the Korean
armistice, and the public anticipated that a substantial decline in military
expenditures would soon follow, sparking concern about an impending
recession (Engelbourg 1980).
During the summer of 1953, the newly reconstituted Council grew
increasingly worried about the possibility of a recession, and spent the next

Box 7-5: Former CEA Chairman Alan Greenspan (1974 – 1977)
In the autumn of 1974, industrial production began to fall rapidly,
and unemployment started to increase rapidly. That the economy was
heading into a recession (if it were not in fact already in one) didn’t
require much debate. By Christmas, the key question for the Ford
Administration’s economic policy was whether we were experiencing an
inventory recession, which would mean a sharp but temporary erosion in
production and employment as businesses worked off excess inventories,
or a far more dangerous softening in the economy engendered by a
persistent weakness in final demand. This was the burning issue for the
President. For a short-term inventory correction, the optimum policy, as
we saw it, was to do as little as politically possible.
The political advice being offered to the administration was
unequivocal. It was typified by the March 1975 testimony of AFL-CIO
president George Meany to Congress that “America is in the worst
economic emergency since the Great Depression … The situation is
frightening now and it is growing more ominous by the day. This is not
just another recession, for it has no parallel in the five recessions in the
post‒World War II period. America is far beyond the point where the
situation can correct itself. Massive government action is needed.”
The Council of Economic Advisers had no real time measure of
the state of demand and inventories. Official estimates of gross national
product (GNP) and its components would answer the vexing question.
But the data required to make the key policy choices would become
available weeks, perhaps months, in the future. In December 1974,
however, CEA developed what amounted to a weekly GNP. It would not
have passed the exacting statistical publication standards of the Bureau
of Economic Analysis of the Department of Commerce, but it was more
than adequate—in fact, quite instrumental—in answering the question
of whether we were experiencing an inventory recession, a final demand
recession, or both.
While the Department of Commerce has since abandoned its
weekly retail sales series, it nonetheless did yeoman service during that
period in indicating that personal consumption expenditures were not
undergoing a downward plunge. This was confirmed by the timely
10-day data of full coverage of motor vehicle sales. The other sectors of
the economy had to be estimated more indirectly. Industry trade sources,
coupled with the latest data on building permits (which leads residential
construction) outlined the residential sector for us. Survey forecasts of
plant and equipment, monthly new orders and shipments for machinery,
data on nonresidential construction, and, with a delay, imports of capital
equipment constructed a crude proxy for capital investment. From

320  |  Chapter 7

the unemployment insurance system we were able to develop a rough
indicator of aggregate hours worked, which, combined with an estimate
of output per work hour (which were little more than educated guesses),
yielded a rough preliminary estimate of total real GNP, which was then
adjusted to reconcile with its component parts.
These data indicated, with some degree of robustness, something
that we knew for a fact only much later: that the rate of inventory liquidation—the gap between GNP and final demand—was exceptionally
large by historic standards. That gap reflected the fact that production
had been cut well below the level of final demand in order to work off
the excess inventories that had accumulated. Therefore, if final demand
continued to stabilize, as apparently it was doing in the early weeks of
1975, the recession’s low point was close at hand and a marked rebound
from the downturn was highly likely. Inventory liquidation cannot go
on indefinitely. The rate must eventually slow, and that process closes
the gap between final demand and production, sometimes quite rapidly.
It soon became clear from the weekly insured unemployment data
and several qualitative indicators that the worst was over.1 At that point
we could conclude that further expansionary fiscal measures beyond
the modest initiatives of the Ford Administration would be unnecessary
and in the long run could turn out to be counterproductive. Short-term
emergency GNP monitoring was no longer necessary and the short, but
admirable, history of the weekly GNP came to a close.

few months documenting economic data showing worsening conditions.
CEA’s new chairman, Arthur Burns, was an expert on business cycles, and
was considered to be “a champion of empirical, or inductive, economics, preferring to draw conclusions and base policy upon observable facts
rather than deductively from theoretical relationships and models” (Flash
1965). Thus, over the next several months, the Council monitored various
economic indicators, such as unemployment, stock prices, commercial construction, new housing starts, farm income, business inventory accumulation, and business sales, and submitted regular updates to the President and
other agencies.
In addition to monitoring economic developments, the Council also
began actively helping to develop a counter-recessionary strategy. First, the
Council attempted to convince the Federal Reserve to ease the money supply
and credit, and Burns “lost no opportunity to seek its cooperation” (Norton
1977). (Note that the Federal Reserve has long-established independence,
and Executive Branch policy in recent administrations has been to not

comment on or in any way attempt to influence its actions.) Second, CEA
advocated for reducing Federal taxes to stimulate demand, contrary to the
views of then-Treasury Secretary George Humphrey, who was concerned
about tax cuts adding to the deficit.5 Finally, CEA advocated for increased
public works spending, developing various proposals and publicly calling for
it in the 1954 Economic Report of the President. However, Burns recognized
that public works projects would take a long time to implement and take
effect, and the Council ultimately advised that extra public works funds
should only be requested if unemployment reached six million in 1954,
which never came close to occurring (Engelbourg 1980). Thus, although the
Council and others within the administration devoted much deliberation to
planning public works activities, in the end, their practical effects were fairly
minimal.
In the end, the economy experienced a relatively short and mild recession, an outcome that helped CEA reach “a high-water mark of prestige and
acceptance” (Flash 1965).6 Moreover, as noted previously, this was the first
time that a major tax cut had been implemented at the time of a budgetary
shortfall to counter a recession. According to the 1966 Economic Report of
the President, the administration’s actions in 1954 established “the bipartisan
character of expansionary fiscal policies … for the first time” (CEA 1966).
That being said, some have argued that the Council’s work in monitoring and informing the administration and the public about economic
developments was ultimately more influential than its direct efforts to promote specific countercyclical policies. Edward Flash writes:
Burns’ inductive economics reinforced policy objectives and provided
an excellent analysis of unfolding developments ... Except for underestimating the reductions in government expenditures for fiscal 1954
and allegedly overestimating administrative budget flexibility, the
Council correctly assessed the mildness of the recession and provided
5 Only a couple years later, their roles in the debate were reversed. In 1956, Burns and
Humphrey took opposite sides in another dispute, with Humphrey arguing for a tax reduction
and Burns arguing against it, because inflation was beginning to pick up. Humphrey scheduled
a meeting to make his case to President Eisenhower. Burns’s account of the meeting is as
follows: “Eisenhower greeted us with his customary enthusiasm: ‘My two friends, just the
two men I wanted to see. I just had a damn fool businessman in here saying that we ought to
lower taxes now, this at a time when inflation is beginning to heat up—to lower taxes! Can
you imagine any idiocy like that?’ I took out a handkerchief and covered my face … It was all
I could do to control myself from bursting out laughing. Well, there was talk about all kinds of
things for about an hour and a quarter. I did not say one word. I was waiting for Humphrey;
but he never got around to the subject of the meeting” (Hargrove and Morley 1984).
6 Chairman Burns’s efforts also won praise from President Eisenhower, with the President
remarking to him one day, “Arthur, my boy, you would have made a fine chief of staff overseas
during the war” (Norton 1977).

322  |  Chapter 7

an informational basis for appropriate Administration policies.
Through Burns, the Council kept the President and the Cabinet
informed; through ABEGS [the Advisory Board on Economic Growth
and Stability], chaired by Burns, the Council accomplished the same
thing with departments and agencies. To the President, Burns provided constant and expert counsel; to the departments he conveyed
an overview of recession developments and governmental countermoves that transcended particular operational operations and outlook (1965).
By contrast, Flash argues that “it appears reasonable to conclude that
… one, the Council’s influence on the [F]ederal [G]overnment’s actions of
tax reduction and monetary easing which most significantly contributed to
recovery was minor and two, those instances where its influence was significant involved actions that did not bulk large in recovery impact” (1965).
For instance, he notes that much of the tax reduction that was enacted had
already been scheduled to go into effect: the personal income tax reduction
was implemented as a result of legislation enacted during the Korean War
mobilization, and the excess profits tax was scheduled to expire automatically. CEA did persuade the President to pass an additional tax reduction of
$1.4 billion, but by the time it was implemented, the recovery was already
underway.

The 1970s and Stagflation
Of course, there have also been moments in CEA’s history where its
interpretation of economic trends and its understanding of the appropriate
policy response have proved deficient. Herbert Stein notes that the 1970s
were a particularly difficult time for CEA:
The later Nixon years, the Ford years and the Carter years were
a period in which the CEA struggled with problems for which the
economics profession was unprepared. High unemployment and high
inflation persisted. Fiscal policy was dominated by concern with rising expenditures and deficits. The growth rate of potential output
seemed to be slowing down for reasons that were not understood
(1996).
Stein writes that CEA’s “most serious error” during the Nixon
Administration was thinking that the natural rate of unemployment was 4
percent. This led the Council to think that it only had to let unemployment
rise slightly above that before inflation would start to dissipate. Yet CEA was
proven wrong, and when unemployment rose to 6 percent with no sign of
The 70th Anniversary of the Council of Economic Advisers  |  323

progress, “confidence in the policy of ‘gradualism’ evaporated … [which]
helped to set the stage for the radical move to price and wage controls, which
the CEA had not foreseen and did not want” (1996).
More generally, Stein comments that two institutional deficiencies
of CEA are that “it does not look far enough ahead, but gets too engrossed
in immediate problems … [and that] like the government as a whole, is
deficient in contingency planning.” To remedy the first problem, Stein
advises that “[i]t might be useful to segregate a portion of the staff, under the
guidance of one of the members, to think only of what the economy and its
problems might look like in, say, 25 years” (1996).

Engage the Economics Community
The final function of CEA is to engage with the economics community, by staying abreast of the latest academic research and by sharing new
insights with policymakers, and in turn, by communicating the administration’s actions and plans to the economics community. This function helps
to support the administration’s efforts to develop economic policies and to
articulate and advance the President’s agenda. While the academic character
of CEA may not have been originally intended by Congress when it created
CEA, this engagement has arguably made the Council a more effective and
durable institution.

The Origins of Economists in the White House
Although CEA is now closely identified with the economics profession, this was not originally the case. J. Bradford DeLong writes that
“[e]stablishing in the White House staff a group of short-term employees
with a primary allegiance to economists’ sense of the public interest may
have been the furthest thing from the minds of those who wrote Section
4 of the 1946 Employment Act” (1996). Rather, during the lead-up to the
passage of the Employment Act, “[t]here were some people in Congress
who envisioned the Council as a representative body … [and that] each one
of the three basic sectors of the American economy; agriculture, industry
and labor, should be represented on the Council” (Naveh 1981). Some supporters of the Employment Act wanted CEA to be staffed by people who
had experience working in government or business, while others wanted to
appoint academic economists.
In the end, the first CEA under President Truman included representation from all of these backgrounds. Nourse was an agricultural economist
who had spent much of his career at the Brookings Institution; Keyserling
was a lawyer who had completed graduate coursework in economics, and
324  |  Chapter 7

had experience working in government and ties to organized labor; and
Clark was a former oil industry executive and a business school dean. By
comparison, the staff recruited to serve on the first Council was comprised
of “[e]conomists who integrated government experience and academic
training” … almost all of whom “could be called government careerists”
(Naveh 1981).
The shift toward hiring more academic economists commenced under
the Burns Council, and intensified during the Heller Council. In part, Burns
started hiring academic economists due to a scarcity of available labor:
“Burns had a hard time finding qualified economists who at the same time,
were not too closely identified with the previous administrations, would
agree to work for President Eisenhower, [and] would stay in Washington
at the time [of] Senator McCarthy’s investigations.” Meanwhile, academic
institutions were a “convenient supplier of temporary personnel” (Naveh
1981). Burns also saw hiring academics as a means of depoliticizing CEA
and establishing its credibility, which was especially important since CEA
had come to be viewed as excessively political during Keyserling’s tenure.

Institutional Advantages and Challenges
CEA’s economic perspective and academic character have, as Burns
intended, helped to insulate it against politics to some extent. As discussed
above, the Council has held a number of the same positions under both
Democratic and Republican administrations. In large part, this is because
CEA tends to reflect the policy views of the economics profession, and on
many (but not all) issues, “there is a distinct consensus among economists”
(Schultze 1996). Murray Weidenbaum notes that when Congress in 1995
was debating whether to continue to fund CEA, “every active Republican
ex-chairman came to the defense of the CEA as well as the Democratic
economists who served on the [C]ouncil” (1996). When the administration changes, the leadership of CEA changes too, but there is a tradition
of its staff continuing to serve through the first summer of the subsequent
administration.
Some former CEA chairs have claimed that the institutional structure
of CEA can help to reinforce its economic perspective. For example, Joseph
Stiglitz argues that the fact that CEA is composed of “citizen-bureaucrats”
who know they will be returning to their academic perches shortly means
that they “have a long-term incentive to maintain [their] professional
reputations” (1997), and that this creates an incentive for CEA staff to
ensure that its recommendations are economically defensible. This point is
echoed by former CEA Chairman Martin Feldstein (1992) and former CEA
Member Jeffrey Frankel (2003). Of course, CEA’s perspective is not unique,
The 70th Anniversary of the Council of Economic Advisers  |  325

Box 7-6: Former CEA Chairman Martin Feldstein (1982 – 1984)
I became Chairman of President Ronald Reagan’s Council of
Economic Advisers in the summer of 1982. I served for two years, the
maximum time allowed by Harvard’s policy of leave for government
service. Acting as CEA chairman provided a crash course in a wide range
of economic issues, including exchange rates, financial regulation and
emerging market deficits, as well as an education in how the political
process works inside the administration and with Congress.
Ronald Reagan made his economic goals very clear: lowering the
rate of inflation, reducing the government’s share of gross domestic
product (GDP) while increasing defense spending, lowering tax rates,
and reducing government regulation. Although he left it to others to
work out the details, he made these things happen because of his skills in
speaking to the American public and his ability to compromise in working with the Congress. He succeeded in achieving his goals, although
never to the extent that he wanted. Government spending fell from 21.6
percent of GDP in 1981 to 20.5 percent in 1989, while the defense share
rose from 5.0 percent to 5.5 percent, taxes fell from 19.1 percent of GDP
to 17.8 percent, and the fiscal deficit excluding interest on the national
debt (the primary balance) fell from 0.3 percent to minus 0.3 percent.
Although the Democrats had an overwhelming majority in the
House of Representatives for the entire eight years of the Reagan
presidency, the President achieved major tax reform (a revenue-neutral
reduction of the top personal tax rate from 50 percent to 28 percent), a
major reform of Social Security (raising the future age for full benefits
from 65 to 67), and a free trade agreement with Canada.
The Federal Reserve under Chairman Paul Volcker (who had been
appointed by President Jimmy Carter and later reappointed by President
Reagan) achieved a rapid fall in inflation from 12.5 percent in 1980 to 3.8
percent in 1982 and 1983. This disinflation involved double-digit interest
rates and a sharp economic downturn. One of my challenges as CEA
chairman was to defend the Federal Reserve’s actions against critics both
inside and outside the administration.
The overall budget deficit increased sharply from 2.5 percent of
GDP in 1981 to 5.9 percent of GDP in 1983. The 25-percent cut in
personal tax rates that was enacted in 1981 was not expected to result
in such a large deficit increase because, with tax brackets not indexed to
inflation before 1986, it was projected that the high inflation that prevailed before the tax cuts would raise taxable incomes to offset the cut in
tax rates. The unexpectedly rapid fall in inflation reduced the offsetting
tax revenue. Although some of the rise in the fiscal deficit was also due
to the recession that began in 1981, a net increase in the structural deficit

326  |  Chapter 7

remained. I joined forces with Budget Director David Stockman to argue
that revenue increases as well as spending cuts were needed to shrink
that structural deficit. Although the political side of the White House
criticized me for this position, President Reagan made no objections and
did support annual revenue-raising changes in corporate taxation while
sticking with his promise not to raise taxes on “hard-working families
struggling to make ends meet.”
Although there were very good economists in several different
cabinet departments, I realized that they each had two roles. In addition
to advising the cabinet member who was the head of their department,
they had to represent their department’s position at interdepartmental
meetings. I therefore found myself debating with these economists at
meetings while suspecting that they were presenting their department’s
positions rather than their professional judgments. Perhaps they didn’t
mind losing some of those debates.
In my meetings with economic officials of other countries, I came to
appreciate the unique role of the Council. As CEA chairman, I reported
directly to the President and presented my own views in testimony to
Congress. In contrast, the senior economic officials in other countries
were often political figures rather than professional economists, or were
economists who reported only privately to a minister of finance.
The team at the CEA is also unusual in being academics serving for
only one or two years (except for the very valuable long-term statistical
staff). This meant having very high quality people who brought up-todate professional thinking, but who had to learn quickly the details of
policy issues. William Poole and William Niskanen were already members of the CEA when I arrived and continued to work with me during
my two years. The people I recruited as members of the staff included
Democrats as well as Republicans, chosen for their analytic abilities,
including Larry Summers, Paul Krugman, John Cochrane and Jeff
Frankel, as well as younger economists Ken Froot, Larry Lindsey, Greg
Mankiw and Katherine Utgoff, and others whose political affiliations I
did not know. Although the White House personnel office was surprised
when they eventually discovered some of their political affiliations, there
was no attempt to change these appointments or limit what I did in my
second-year appointments.
One of the many pleasures in working with President Reagan was
his positive and optimistic attitude. It no doubt made it possible for him
to work successfully with both Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
But it sometimes made it difficult for me to convince him of the need
to adopt certain policy changes. I recall one occasion after I had just
had one of my Oval Office meetings with the President in which I said

The 70th Anniversary of the Council of Economic Advisers  |  327

that it would be very risky not to make a particular policy change. The
President asked whether continuing with the current policy was sure to
create a problem. I said that I couldn’t be certain of that but that the current policy would have a very low probability of success. I thought that
my argument would have persuaded a typical prudent corporate CEO
to make the change that I was suggesting. But the President decided not
to do so.
As I left the Oval Office I realized that the President’s optimism
and his willingness to take a long shot on policy was not an accident but
was based on his own life history. He started as a radio sports announcer
but was soon a major movie star in Hollywood. When his movie career
came to an end, he eventually went on to become a popular California
governor. He later ran for the nomination as Republican candidate for
the presidency but was defeated. But the next time around he won the
nomination, was elected overwhelmingly, and was reelected four years
later with an even larger margin. And there I was, after his long string
of improbable successes, trying to persuade him not to do something
because it was unlikely to happen.

and policy analysts throughout the Federal Government often hold similar
views as CEA, but CEA is unusual in that providing an economic perspective is essentially its sole institutional purpose (see Box 7-6 for former CEA
Chairman Martin Feldstein’s discussion of CEA’s unusual institutional
structure and CEA’s role in informing fiscal policy during the Reagan
Administration).
CEA’s academic character also helps to bring fresh perspectives on
policy into the government, both by bringing in new people who have new
ideas, and through keeping open the channels of communication with
academia. It also means that CEA’s views about policy tend to reflect economists’ current understanding of how best to promote the public interest. For
example, Charles Schultze notes that CEA regularly supported antitrust policies under the Eisenhower, Kennedy, Ford, and Nixon Administrations, but
that its support for such policies waned during the 1980s as the economics
profession’s views shifted (1996). In recent years, growing evidence of “economic rents” has led CEA, along with many in the economics profession,
to increasingly emphasize the importance of fostering more competitive
markets as a means to address inequality and raise real incomes (see discussion in Chapter 1). In this way, Edwin Nourse’s view of CEA as a “doorway
through which the best thinking of systematic economics … may be brought
into clear and effective focus at the point of executive decision as to national
economic policy and action” has been vindicated (Norton 1977).
328  |  Chapter 7

Of course, relying on short-term academic economists also presents
some notable challenges: CEA’s staff have little institutional memory and
often do not enter government with much knowledge about policy decisionmaking processes or much understanding of the details of how Federal
programs function. In addition, as discussed above, though it is critical to
provide unvarnished economic advice, such advice is likely to be more useful
if it is at least presented with an awareness of the broader political context.
These constraints result in a substantial learning curve for many incoming
CEA staff, and if they are not surmounted, can present barriers to engaging
effectively in the policy process. Some CEAs have attempted to attenuate
these obstacles by including a few government economists on staff and by
relying on several career staff members for institutional memory.

Conclusion
Many of CEA’s contributions are due to its unique institutional structure: that it is a small organization with no regulatory authority of its own,
few direct operational responsibilities, and populated by academic economists. Yet its contributions are also dependent on the ability of its staff to
balance operating effectively in a necessarily political environment without
being overly influenced by politics, and to be effective in advocating for their
positions while providing objective economic advice. All in all, given the
divergent objectives reflected in the Employment Act of 1946, CEA’s turbulent early years, and its unusual institutional structure, CEA has proven to
be a durable and effective advocate for the public interest.

Activities of the Council of Economic Advisers During 2015  | 385

Report to the President
on the Activities of the
Council of Economic Advisers
During 2015
The Council of Economic Advisers was established by the Employment
Act of 1946 to provide the President with objective economic analysis and
advice on the development and implementation of a wide range of domestic
and international economic policy issues. The Council is governed by a
Chairman and two Members. The Chairman is appointed by the President
and confirmed by the United States Senate. The Members are appointed by
the President.

The Chairman of the Council
Jason Furman was confirmed by the Senate on August 1, 2013 as the
28th Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Furman has served the
President since the beginning of the Administration, previously holding the
position of Principal Deputy Director of the National Economic Council and
Assistant to the President. Immediately prior to the Administration, Furman
was Economic Policy Director for the President’s campaign in 2008 and a
member of the Presidential Transition Team.
Furman held a variety of posts in public policy and research before his
work with President Obama. In public policy, Furman worked at both the
Council of Economic Advisers and National Economic Council during the
Clinton administration and also at the World Bank. In research, Furman was
a Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution and the Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities and also has served in visiting positions at various universities, including NYU’s Wagner Graduate School of Public Policy. Furman
has conducted research in a wide range of areas, such as fiscal policy, tax
policy, health economics, Social Security, and domestic and international
macroeconomics. In addition to numerous articles in scholarly journals and
periodicals, Furman is the editor of two books on economic policy. Furman
holds a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University.

Activities of the Council of Economic Advisers During 2015  | 387

The Members of the Council
Sandra E. Black was appointed by the President on August 10, 2015.
She is on leave from the University of Texas, Austin where she holds the
Audre and Bernard Rapoport Centennial Chair in Economics and Public
Affairs and is a Professor of Economics. She received her B.A. from the
University of California, Berkeley and her Ph.D. in economics from Harvard
University.
Jay C. Shambaugh was appointed by the President on August 31, 2015.
He is on leave from George Washington University where he is a Professor of
Economics and International Affairs. Dr. Shambaugh received a B.A. from
Yale, an M.A.L.D. from The Fletcher School at Tufts University, and a Ph.D.
in Economics from the University of California, Berkeley.
Betsey Stevenson resigned as Member of the Council on August
7, 2015 to return to the University of Michigan, where she is Associate
Professor of Public Policy and Economics.
Maurice Obstfeld resigned as Member of the Council on August 28,
2015 to join the International Monetary Fund as Economic Counsellor
and Director of Research while on leave from the University of California,
Berkeley where he is Professor of Economics.

Areas of Activities
A central function of the Council is to advise the President on all
economic issues and developments. In the past year, as in previous years,
advising the President on policies to spur economic growth and job creation,
and evaluating the effects of these policies on the economy, have been
priorities.
The Council works closely with various government agencies,
including the National Economic Council, the Office of Management and
Budget, White House senior staff, and other officials and engages in discussions on numerous policy matters. In the area of international economic
policy, the Council coordinates with other units of the White House, the
Treasury Department, the State Department, the Commerce Department,
and the Federal Reserve on matters related to the global financial system.
Among the specific economic policy areas that received attention in
2015 were: college affordability and quality; health care cost growth and the
Affordable Care Act; infrastructure investment; regulatory measures; trade
policies; poverty and income inequality; unemployment insurance and the
minimum wage; labor force participation; job training; corporate taxation;
regional development; the economic cost of carbon pollution; renewable fuel

standards; energy policy; intellectual property and innovation; and foreign
direct investment. The Council also worked on several issues related to the
quality of the data available for assessing economic conditions.
The Council prepares for the President, the Vice President, and the
White House senior staff a daily economic briefing memo analyzing current
economic developments and almost-daily memos on key economic data
releases. Chairman Furman also presents a monthly briefing on the state
of the economy and the Council’s energy analysis to senior White House
officials.
The Council, the Department of Treasury, and the Office of Management
and Budget—the Administration’s economic “troika”— are responsible for
producing the economic forecasts that underlie the Administration’s budget
proposals. The Council initiates the forecasting process twice each year,
consulting with a wide variety of outside sources, including leading private
sector forecasters and other government agencies.
The Council was an active participant in the trade policy process,
participating in the Trade Policy Staff Committee and the Trade Policy
Review Group. The Council provided analysis and opinions on a range of
trade-related issues involving the enforcement of existing trade agreements,
reviews of current U.S. trade policies, and consideration of future policies. The Council also participated on the Trade Promotion Coordinating
Committee, helping to examine the ways in which exports may support
economic growth in the years to come. In the area of investment and security, the Council participated on the Committee on Foreign Investment in
the United States (CFIUS), reviewing individual cases before the committee.
The Council is a leading participant in the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD), an important forum for economic
cooperation among high-income industrial economies. Chairman Furman is
chairman of the OECD’s Economic Policy Committee, and Council Members
and staff participate actively in working-party meetings on macroeconomic
policy and coordination, and contribute to the OECD’s research agenda.
The Council issued a wide range of reports in 2015. In February, the
Council released a report on the use of big data and its effects on differential
pricing. That same month, CEA analyzed the effects of conflicted investment advice on retirement savings and its role in lower investment returns
for American families. In March, the Council celebrated the Affordable Care
Act’s (ACA) fifth anniversary with a report analyzing progress on coverage,
cost and quality. The Council, in recognition of Equal Pay Day, released an
issue brief on the gender pay gap, recent trends, and explanations for these
developments.

Activities of the Council of Economic Advisers During 2015  | 389

In May, the Council issued a report on the economic benefits of U.S.
trade, focusing on the positive gains from trade integration. Also in May, in
tandem with the Domestic Policy Council and the Office of Management
and Budget, the Council released a report on rural child poverty. There, the
Council analyzed poverty measurement tools, and policy levers targeted at
rural poverty. In June, the Council reported on U.S. petroleum consumption, and the decrease in domestic petroleum consumption in recent years.
In July, the Council continued analysis of the ACA, and released a report on
the consequences of State decisions to not expand Medicaid, finding that
millions of Americans are denied health care coverage as a result of these
choices.
The Council focused in 2015 on investments in children and youth,
releasing a July report on the economic costs of youth disadvantage and
gaps in opportunity for young men of color. The Council also focused on
macroeconomic monitoring, issuing a report on long-term interest rates and
an issue brief on improving the measurement of economic growth by examining Gross Domestic Output, which combines measurement of income and
production. The Council produced a July issue brief on the digital divide,
and the unevenly distributed benefits of access to the Internet. A framework
for policymakers was released that same month in partnership with the
Departments of Labor and Treasury on occupational licensing, and the inefficiencies and inequities incurred by current licensing regimes.
In August, the Council expanded its work on gender equality, releasing
an issue brief on opportunities for women in business, the strides made by
women in the labor market, and barriers that remain for women in business
careers. In the fall, the Council focused on institutions of higher education
in the United States, releasing a report on using federal data to measure and
improve their performance. In support of broader efforts around worker
voice, the Council issued an October issue brief on worker voice in a time of
rising inequality, focusing on increasing wage and income inequality and the
role of unions in wage distribution. In December, the Council released an
issue brief on fines, fees and bails, and the system of payments in the criminal
justice system that disproportionately impact low-income Americans. Finally,

reducing poverty in the United States. All of the aforementioned reports can

General Notes
Detail in these tables may not add to totals due to rounding.
Because of the formula used for calculating real gross domestic product
(GDP), the chained (2009) dollar estimates for the detailed components do
not add to the chained-dollar value of GDP or to any intermediate aggregate.
The Department of Commerce (Bureau of Economic Analysis) no longer
publishes chained-dollar estimates prior to 1999, except for selected series.
Because of the method used for seasonal adjustment, the sum or average of
seasonally adjusted monthly values generally will not equal annual totals
based on unadjusted values.
Unless otherwise noted, all dollar figures are in current dollars.
Symbols used:

... Not available (also, not applicable).
Data in these tables reflect revisions made by source agencies through
February 5, 2016, unless otherwise noted.

1 Data on Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) basis include transportation and public utilities. Those on North American Industry Classification System
(NAICS) basis include transporation and warehousing. Utilities classified separately in NAICS (as shown beginning 1998).
2 SIC-based industry data use the 1987 SIC for data beginning in 1987 and the 1972 SIC for prior data. NAICS-based data use 2002 NAICS.
Note: Industry data on SIC basis and NAICS basis are not necessarily the same and are not strictly comparable.

1 Authorized by issuance of local building permits in permit-issuing places: 20,100 places beginning with 2014; 19,300 for 2004–2013; 19,000 for 1994–2003;
17,000 for 1984–93; 16,000 for 1978–83; and 14,000 for 1972–77.
2 Monthly data do not meet publication standards because tests for identifiable and stable seasonality do not meet reliability standards.
Note: One-unit estimates prior to 1999, for new housing units started and completed and for new houses sold, include an upward adjustment of 3.3 percent
to account for structures in permit-issuing areas that did not have permit authorization.

1 The term “family” refers to a group of two or more persons related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together. Every family must include a
reference person.
2 Adjusted by consumer price index research series (CPI-U-RS).
3 Data for American Indians and Alaska natives, native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders, and those reporting two or more races are included in the total
but not shown separately.
4 Beginning with data for 2009, the upper income interval used to calculate median incomes was expanded to $250,000 or more.
5 Reflects implementation of Census 2010-based population controls comparable to succeeding years.
6 The 2014 Current Population Survey (CPS) Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) included redesigned income questions, which were
implemented to a subsample of the 98,000 addresses using a probability split panel design. These 2013 data are based on the 2014 ASEC sample of 68,000
addresses that received income questions similar to those used in the 2013 ASEC and are consistent with data in earlier years.
7 These 2013 data are based on the 2014 ASEC sample of 30,000 addresses that received redesigned income questions and are consistent with data in later
years.
8 The CPS allows respondents to choose more than one race. Data shown are for “white alone, non-Hispanic,” “black alone,” and “Asian alone” race
categories. (“Black” is also “black or African American.”) Family race and Hispanic origin are based on the reference person.
Note: Poverty thresholds are updated each year to reflect changes in the consumer price index (CPI-U).
For details see publication Series P–60 on the Current Population Survey and Annual Social and Economic Supplements.

5 Beginning in 2000, data for agricultural employment are for agricultural and related industries; data for this series and for nonagricultural employment are
not strictly comparable with data for earlier years. Because of independent seasonal adjustment for these two series, monthly data will not add to total civilian
employment.
Note: Labor force data in Tables B–11 through B–13 are based on household interviews and usually relate to the calendar week that includes the 12th of
the month. Historical comparability is affected by revisions to population controls, changes in occupational and industry classification, and other changes to the
survey. In recent years, updated population controls have been introduced annually with the release of January data, so data are not strictly comparable with
earlier periods. Particularly notable changes were introduced for data in the years 1953, 1960, 1962, 1972, 1973, 1978, 1980, 1990, 1994, 1997, 1998, 2000,
2003, 2008 and 2012. For definitions of terms, area samples used, historical comparability of the data, comparability with other series, etc., see Employment
and Earnings or concepts and methodology of the CPS at http://www.bls.gov/cps/documentation.htm#concepts.

2 Yields on the more actively traded issues adjusted to constant maturities by the Department of the Treasury. The 30-year Treasury constant maturity series
was discontinued on February 18, 2002, and reintroduced on February 9, 2006.
3 Beginning with December 7, 2001, data for corporate Aaa series are industrial bonds only.
4 Effective rate (in the primary market) on conventional mortgages, reflecting fees and charges as well as contract rate and assuming, on the average,
repayment at end of 10 years. Rates beginning with January 1973 not strictly comparable with prior rates.
5 For monthly data, high and low for the period. Prime rate for 1947–1948 are ranges of the rate in effect during the period.
6 Primary credit replaced adjustment credit as the Federal Reserve’s principal discount window lending program effective January 9, 2003.
7 Since July 19, 1975, the daily effective rate is an average of the rates on a given day weighted by the volume of transactions at these rates. Prior to that date,
the daily effective rate was the rate considered most representative of the day’s transactions, usually the one at which most transactions occurred.
