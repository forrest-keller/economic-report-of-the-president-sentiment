ECONOMIC REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT

To the Congress of the United States:
As 2004 begins, America’s economy is strong and getting stronger. Over the
past several years, this Nation has faced major economic challenges resulting
from the decline of the stock market beginning in early 2000, a recession that
began shortly after, revelations about corporate governance scandals, slow
growth among many of our major trading partners, terrorist attacks, and the
war against terror, including in Afghanistan and Iraq. These challenges affected
business and consumer confidence and resulted in hardship for people in
many industries and regions of our Nation. Americans have responded to each
challenge, and now we have the results: renewed confidence, strong growth,
new jobs, and a mounting prosperity that will reach every corner of America.
This Report, prepared by my Council of Economic Advisers, describes the
economic challenges we faced, the actions we took, and the results we are
seeing. It also discusses our plan to continue growing the economy and
creating jobs.
In May 2003, I signed a Jobs and Growth bill that focused on three key
goals. First, we accelerated previously passed tax relief and let American households keep more of their own money to save, invest, and spend. Second, we
increased incentives for small businesses to invest in new equipment and plant
expansions. Third, we enacted important tax relief on dividend income and
capital gains to help investors and businesses. These actions were designed to
promote investment, job creation, and income growth. By all three measures of
performance, we are seeing signs of success.
Since May 2003, we have seen the economy grow at its fastest pace in nearly
20 years. Consumers and businesses have gained confidence. Retail sales are
strong, and Americans are buying, building, and renovating houses at a record
pace. Investment has strengthened, with spending on business equipment the best
in 5 years. The unemployment rate has fallen from its peak of 6.3 percent last June
to 5.7 percent in December, and employment is beginning to rise as new jobs are

created, especially in small business. Productivity growth has been strong, leading to
higher incomes for workers, while the tax relief we passed means that American
families keep more of their money instead of sending it to Washington.
We are moving in the right direction, but have more to do. I will not be
satisfied until every American who wants a job can find one. I have outlined a
six-point plan to promote job creation and strong economic growth. This plan
includes initiatives to help manage rising health care costs to make health care
more affordable and accessible for American workers and families; reduce the
burden of junk lawsuits on the economy; ensure a reliable and affordable energy
supply; simplify and streamline government regulations; open foreign markets
for American goods and services; and allow businesses and families to keep more
of their hard-earned money and plan with confidence by making our tax relief
permanent. This year, I will work with the Congress to achieve these goals.
I will also continue to work with the Congress on another important shared
goal: controlling federal spending and reducing the deficit. The federal budget is
in deficit, foremost because of the economic slowdown and then recession that
began in 2000 and the additional costs of fighting the war on terror and
protecting the homeland. We are continuing to take action to restrain spending
and bring the deficit down. By carefully evaluating priorities and being good
stewards of the taxpayer’s money, we will cut the budget deficit in half over the
next five years.
The task of reducing the deficit will become easier because America’s economy is
growing. We have taken the actions needed to restore growth, and we are pursuing
additional policies to help create jobs for American workers and families. I’m
optimistic about the future of our economy because I know the values of America
and the decency and entrepreneurial spirit of our people.

Overview

T

he U.S. economy made notable progress in 2003, propelled forward by
pro-growth policies that led to a marked strengthening of activity in the
second half of the year and put the United States on a path for higher
sustained output growth in the years to come.
The recovery was still tenuous coming into 2003, as continued fallout from
powerful contractionary forces—the capital overhang, corporate scandals, and
uncertainty about future economic and geopolitical conditions—was offset
by stimulus from expansionary monetary policy and the Administration’s
2001 tax cut and 2002 fiscal package. The contractionary forces dissipated
over the course of 2003, and the expansionary forces were augmented by the
Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (JGTRRA) that was signed
into law at the end of May.
The economy appears to have moved into a full-fledged recovery, with real
gross domestic product (GDP), the most comprehensive measure of the
output of the U.S. economy, expanding at an annual rate of more than
8 percent in the third quarter of the year. Based on data available through the
middle of January, a further solid gain appears likely in the fourth quarter (the
GDP estimate for the fourth quarter was released after this Report went to
press). Job growth, however, began to pick up only late in 2003.
This Report discusses this turning of the macroeconomic tide, along with a
number of other economic policy issues of continuing importance. The
14 chapters of this Report cover five broad topics: macroeconomic policy,
fiscal policy, regulation, reforms of the health care and tort systems, and issues
in international trade and finance. In all of these areas, the Report highlights
how economics can inform the design of public policy and discusses
Administration policies.
The Administration’s pro-growth tax policy, in concert with the dynamism of
the U.S. free-market economy, has laid the groundwork for sustainable rapid
growth in the years ahead. Well-timed fiscal stimulus combined with expansionary monetary policy to offset and eventually reverse the contractionary forces
impacting the economy. But there is still much to be done. The tax cuts must be
made permanent to have their full beneficial impact on the economy. A stronger
economy will also result from progress on the other aspects of the
Administration’s economic agenda, including making health care more affordable; reducing the burden of lawsuits on the economy; ensuring an affordable and
reliable energy supply; streamlining regulations; and opening markets to international trade. These initiatives are discussed in this Economic Report of the President.

Macroeconomic Policy
Chapter 1, Lessons from the Recent Business Cycle, discusses the distinctive
features of the recent recession and subsequent recovery, and draws five key
lessons for the future. The recent business cycle was unusual in that it was
characterized by especially weak business investment but robust consumption
and housing investment. This makes clear the first lesson, that structural
imbalances such as the “capital overhang” that developed in the late 1990s
can take some time to resolve. A number of events contributed to a climate
of uncertainty in 2003, including the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,
corporate governance and accounting scandals, and geopolitical tensions
surrounding the war with Iraq. The second lesson from the recent business
cycle is that the effects of the uncertainty from these events on household and
business confidence can have important effects on asset prices, household
spending, and investment. Resolution of some of the uncertainties appears to
have contributed to the resurgence of growth.
Monetary and fiscal policies played a critical role in moving the economy
back toward potential. The third lesson is that aggressive monetary policy can
help make a recession shorter and milder. The fourth lesson is that tax cuts
can likewise boost economic activity. Tax cuts raise after-tax income, while at
the same time promoting long-term growth by enhancing incentives to work,
save, and invest. Tax relief enacted in 2001 and 2002 helped lessen the
severity of the recession, while the 2003 tax cut appears to have propelled the
economy forward into a strong recovery. Job creation has lagged behind, even
as demand has surged. Thus, the fifth lesson of the recent recession is that
strong productivity growth, as was experienced in 2003, means that much
faster economic growth is needed to raise employment. This productivity
growth, however, is not to be lamented, since it ultimately leads to higher
standards of living for both workers and business owners.
Chapter 2, The Manufacturing Sector, examines recent developments and
long-term trends in manufacturing and considers policy responses.
Manufacturing was affected by the economic slowdown earlier, longer, and
harder than other sectors of the economy and manufacturing employment
losses have only recently begun to abate. The severity of the recent slowdown
in manufacturing was largely due to prolonged weakness in business
investment and exports, both of which are heavily tied to manufacturing.
Over the past several decades, the manufacturing sector has experienced
substantial output growth, even while manufacturing employment has
declined as a share of total employment. The manufacturing employment
decline over the past half-century primarily reflects striking gains in productivity and increasing consumer demand for services compared to
manufactured goods. International trade has played a relatively small role by
18 | Economic Report of the President

comparison. Consumers and businesses generally benefit from the lower
prices made possible by increased manufacturing productivity, and strong
productivity growth has led to real compensation growth for workers. While
the shift of jobs from manufacturing to services has caused dislocation, it has
not resulted, on balance, in a shift from “good jobs” to “bad jobs.” The best
policy response to recent developments in manufacturing is to focus on
stimulating the overall economy and easing restrictions that impede manufacturing growth. This Administration has actively pursued such measures.
Chapter 3, The Year in Review and the Years Ahead, reviews macroeconomic developments in 2003 and discusses the Administration forecast for
2004 through 2009. Real GDP growth picked up appreciably in 2003, with
growth in consumer spending, residential investment, and, particularly,
business equipment and software investment increasing noticeably in the
second half of the year. The labor market began to rebound in the final five
months of 2003. Inflation remained well in check, with core consumer inflation declining by the end of the year to its lowest level in decades. The
improvement in the economy over the course of the year stemmed largely
from faster growth in household consumption, extraordinary gains in residential investment, and a sharp acceleration of investment in equipment and
software by businesses. Payroll employment bottomed out in July and
increased by 278,000 over the remainder of the year. Financial markets
responded favorably to the strengthening of the economy, with the total
value of the stock market rising more than $3 trillion, or 31 percent, over
the course of 2003.
The Administration expects the economic recovery to strengthen further
in 2004, with real GDP growth running well above its historical average and
the unemployment rate falling. Boosted by pro-growth policies and expansionary monetary policy, and on the foundation of the underlying strength
of the free-market society in the United States, the economy is expected to
continue on a path of strong, sustainable growth.

Fiscal Policy
Chapter 4, Tax Incidence: Who Bears the Tax Burden?, discusses the analysis
of how the burden of a tax is distributed among taxpayers. This question is
important to policy makers, who want to know whether the distribution of
the tax burden (between rich and poor, capital and labor, consumers and
producers, and so on) meets their criteria for fairness. The key result is that
the economic incidence of a tax may have little to do with the legal specification of its incidence. Rather, it depends on the actions of market
participants in response to the imposition of the tax.
Overview

| 19

Distributional tables showing the tax burdens borne by different income
groups are an important application of incidence analysis. When used properly, distributional tables can contribute to informed decision making on the
part of citizens and policy makers. Unfortunately, mainstream economic
analysis suggests that these tables do not always accurately describe who
bears the burden of certain taxes. This problem does not arise from bias or
lack of economic knowledge on the part of the economists who prepare
these tables. Instead, it reflects resource and data limitations, uncertainty
about some of the economic effects of taxes, and variations in the time frame
considered by the analyses. Nevertheless, the shortcomings of distributional
tables can lead to misperceptions of the impact of tax changes.
An important implication of the economic analysis of incidence is that, in
the long run, a large part of the burden of capital taxes is likely to be shifted
to workers through a reduction in wages. Analyses that fail to recognize this
shift can be misleading, suggesting that lower income groups bear an unrealistically small share of the burden of such taxes and an unrealistically small
share of the gain when capital income taxes are lowered.
Chapter 5, Dynamic Revenue and Budget Estimation, examines how taxes
affect the behavior of firms, workers, and investors and discusses the implications for the estimated effects of a tax change on revenue. Changes in taxes
and spending generally alter incentives for work, investment, and other
productive activity—a higher tax on an activity tends to discourage that
activity. Revenue estimation is called dynamic if it incorporates the behavioral responses to tax changes and static if it does not incorporate these
behavioral responses.
To make informed decisions about a policy change, policy makers should
be aware of all aspects of its budgetary implications. Currently, official
revenue estimates of proposed tax changes incorporate the revenue effects of
many microeconomic behavioral responses. However, these estimates are
not fully dynamic because they exclude the effects of macroeconomic behavioral responses. Several obstacles have prevented macroeconomic behavioral
responses from being incorporated in such estimates. This chapter discusses
the ongoing efforts to provide a greater role for fully dynamic revenue and
budget estimation in the analysis of major tax and spending proposals. At
least in the near term, it may not be practical for macroeconomic effects to
be incorporated in official estimates. But estimates of these effects should be
provided as supplementary information for major tax and spending
proposals. Dynamic estimation of policy changes should distinguish aggregate demand effects from aggregate supply effects, include long-run effects,
apply to spending as well as tax changes, reflect the differing effects of
various policy changes, account for the need to finance policy changes, and
use a variety of models.
20 | Economic Report of the President

Reform of entitlement programs remains the most pressing fiscal policy
issue confronting the Nation. Chapter 6, Restoring Solvency to Social Security,
examines the largest entitlement program. Social Security is a pay-as-you-go
system in which payroll taxes on the wages of current workers finance the
benefits being paid to current retirees. While the program is running a small
surplus at present, deficits are projected to appear in 15 years; by 2080, the
Social Security deficit is projected to exceed 2.3 percent of GDP. These
deficits are driven by two demographic shifts that have been underway for
several decades: people are having fewer children and are living longer. The
President has called for new initiatives to modernize Social Security to
contain costs, expand choice, and make the program secure and financially
viable for future generations of Americans.
This chapter assesses the need to strengthen Social Security in light of its
long-term financial outlook. The most straightforward way to characterize
the financial imbalance in entitlement programs such as Social Security is by
considering their long-term annual deficits. Even after the baby-boom
generation’s effect is no longer felt, Social Security is projected to incur
annual deficits greater than 50 percent of payroll tax revenues. These deficits
are so large that they require a meaningful change to Social Security in
future years. Reform should include moderation of the growth of benefits
that are unfunded and would otherwise require higher taxes in the future.
However, the benefits promised to those in or near retirement should be
maintained in full. A new system of personal retirement accounts should be
established to help pay future benefits. The economic rationale for undertaking this reform in an era of budget deficits is as compelling as it was in
an era of budget surpluses.

Regulation
Chapter 7, Government Regulation in a Free-Market Society, discusses the
role of the free market in providing for prosperity in the United States and
considers situations in which government interventions such as regulations
would be beneficial. An important reason for Americans' high standard of
living is that they rely primarily on markets to allocate resources. The
government enables the system to work by enforcing property rights and
contracts. Typically, free markets allocate resources to their highest-valued
uses, avoid waste, prevent shortages, and foster innovation. By providing a
legal foundation for transactions, the government makes the market system
reliable: it gives people certainty about what they can trade and keep, and it
allows people to establish terms of trade that will be honored by both sellers
and buyers. The absence of any one of these elements—competition,
Overview

| 21

enforceable property rights, or an ability to form mutually advantageous
contracts—can result in inefficiency and lower living standards. In some
cases, government intervention in a market, for example through regulation,
can create gains for society by remedying shortcomings in the market’s operation. Poorly designed or unnecessary regulations, however, can actually
create new problems or make society worse off by damaging the elements of
the market system that do work.
Chapter 8, Regulating Energy Markets, discusses economic issues relevant
to several energy markets, including natural gas, gasoline, electricity, and
crude oil. While energy markets generally function well, some parts of the
energy industry have characteristics associated with market failures. These
could stem from the large fixed costs required to construct distribution
networks for electricity and natural gas that give rise to market power in the
form of a natural monopoly. Alternatively, the market may not function well
in the presence of negative externalities, such as when energy producers and
consumers do not fully take into account the fact that burning fossil fuels
may cause acid rain or smog.
Minimizing disruptions is an important consideration in the design of
regulations to address shortcomings in energy markets. Federal, state, and
local regulations can have conflicting goals. If the conflicting goals are not
balanced, competing regulations could lead to worse problems than the
market failures the regulations attempt to address. Moreover, regulations
need to be updated as markets evolve over time to ensure that their original
goals still apply and that these regulations are still the lowest-cost means of
meeting those goals.
The chapter also examines global trade in energy products. The United
States benefits from international trade in energy products because meeting
all U.S. energy needs from domestic sources would require significant and
costly changes to the U.S. economy, including changes in the types of transportation fuels used by Americans. But this leads to the possibility of
occasional supply disruptions. An important consideration is that the price
of oil is set in global markets, so that disruptions to the supply of oil from
areas that do not supply the United States affect domestic prices of oil even
if U.S. imports are not directly affected. Fortunately, changes in the U.S.
economy over the past three decades and the increasing sophistication of
financial markets have diminished the impact of supply disruptions and
temporary price changes on the United States.
Finally, the chapter considers the role for government in subsidizing
research and development into new energy sources. In general, policy
makers should avoid forcing commercialization of new energy sources
before market signals indicate that a shift is required. One potential problem
with forcing this process is that technological breakthroughs may lead to
22 | Economic Report of the President

alternatives in the future that are hard to imagine today. Premature adoption
of new technologies would raise energy costs before the need arises, causing
society as a whole to spend more on energy than needed.
Chapter 9, Protecting the Environment, discusses market-oriented
approaches to safeguarding and improving the environment. While the freemarket system typically promotes efficiency and economic growth, the
absence of property rights for environmental “goods” such as clean air and
water can lead to negative externalities that reduce societal well-being. This
problem can be addressed by establishing and enforcing property rights that
will lead the interested parties to negotiate mutually beneficial outcomes in
a market setting. If such negotiations are expensive, however, the government can design regulations that consider both the benefits of reducing the
environmental externality as well as the costs of the regulations.
Regulations should be designed to achieve environmental goals at the
lowest possible cost, promoting both environmental protection and
continued economic growth. Indeed, economic growth can lead to increased
demand for environmental improvements and provide the resources that
make it possible to address environmental problems. Some policies aimed at
improving the environment can entail substantial economic costs.
Misguided policies might actually achieve less environmental progress than
alternative policies for the same cost. Environmental risks should be evaluated using sound scientific methods to avoid possible distortions of
regulatory priorities. Market-based regulations, such as the cap-and-trade
programs promoted by the Administration to reduce common air pollutants, can achieve environmental goals at lower cost than inflexible
command-and-control regulations.

Reforms of Health Care and the Legal System
Chapter 10, Health Care and Insurance, discusses the roles of innovation,
insurance, and reform in the health care market. U.S. markets provide
incentives to develop innovative health care products and services that
benefit both Americans and the global community. The breadth and pace of
innovation in the provision of health care in the United States over the past
few decades have been astounding. New treatment options, however, have
also been associated with higher costs and concerns about affordability.
Research suggests that between 50 and 75 percent of the growth in health
expenditures in the United States is attributable to technological progress in
health care goods and services. A strong reliance on market mechanisms will
ensure that incentives for innovation are maintained while providing
high-quality care in the most cost-efficient manner.
Overview

| 23

Health insurance plays a central role in the workings of the U.S. health
care market. An understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of health
insurance as a payment mechanism for health care is essential to the design
of reforms that retain incentives for innovation while reining in unnecessary
expenditures. Over-reliance on health insurance as a payment mechanism
leads to an inefficient use of resources in providing and utilizing health care.
Reforms should provide consumers and health care providers with more
flexibility, more choices, more information, and more control over their
health care decisions.
Chapter 11, The Tort System, discusses the role of the U.S. tort system and
the considerable burden it imposes on the U.S. economy. The tort system is
intended to compensate accident victims and to deter potential defendants
from putting others at risk. Empirical evidence, however, is mixed on whether
the tort system effectively deters negligent behavior. Moreover, the tort system
is a costly method of providing insurance against a limited number of injuries.
Research suggests that tort liability also leads to lower spending on research
and development, higher health care costs, and job losses.
Ways to reduce the burden of the tort system include limits on noneconomic damages, class action reforms, trust funds for payments to victims
such as in asbestos, and allowing parties to avoid the tort system contractually. The Administration has proposed a number of reforms to reduce the
burden of the tort system while ensuring that people with legitimate claims
can recover damages.

International Trade and Finance
Chapter 12, International Trade and Cooperation, discusses how growing
trade helps to spur U.S. and global growth. Since the end of the Second
World War, international trade has grown steadily relative to overall
economic activity. Over time, countries that have been more open to international flows of goods, services, and capital have grown faster than countries
that were less open to the global economy. The United States has been a
driving force in constructing an open global trading system. The
Administration has pursued, and will continue to pursue, an ambitious
agenda of trade liberalization through negotiations at the global, regional,
and bilateral levels.
New types of trade deliver new benefits to consumers and firms in open
economies. Growing international demand for goods such as movies, pharmaceuticals, and recordings offers new opportunities for U.S. exporters. A
burgeoning trade in services provides an important outlet for U.S. expertise
in sectors such as banking, engineering, and higher education. The ability to
24 | Economic Report of the President

buy less expensive goods and services from new producers has made household budgets go further, while the ability of firms to distribute their
production around the world has cut costs and thus prices to consumers.
The benefits from new forms of trade, such as in services, are no different
from the benefits from traditional trade in goods. Outsourcing of professional services is a prominent example of a new type of trade. The gains from
trade that take place over the Internet or telephone lines are no different
than the gains from trade in physical goods transported by ship or plane.
When a good or service is produced at lower cost in another country, it
makes sense to import it rather than to produce it domestically. This allows
the United States to devote its resources to more productive purposes.
Although openness to trade provides substantial benefits to nations as a
whole, foreign competition can require adjustment on the part of some individuals, businesses, and industries. To help workers adversely affected by
trade develop the skills needed for new jobs, the Administration has worked
hard to build upon and develop programs to assist workers and communities
that are negatively affected by trade.
The Administration has also worked to strengthen and extend the global
trading system. International cooperation is essential to realizing the potential gains from trade. International trade agreements have reduced barriers
to international commerce, and contributed to the gains from trade. A
system through which countries can resolve disputes can play an important
role in realizing these gains.
Chapter 13, International Capital Flows, discusses the economic benefits
and risks associated with the transfer of financial assets, such as cash, stocks,
and bonds, across international borders. Capital flows have become an
increasingly significant part of the world economy over the past decade, and
an important source of funds to support investment in the United States.
Around $2 trillion of capital flowed into all countries in the world in 2002,
with around $700 billion flowing into just the United States. Different types
of capital flows—such as foreign direct investment, portfolio investment,
and bank lending—are driven by different investor motivations and country
characteristics. Countries that permit free capital flows must choose between
the stability provided by fixed exchange rates and the flexibility afforded by
an independent monetary policy.
Capital flows can have a number of benefits for economies around the
world. For example, foreign direct investment can facilitate the transfer of
technology, allow for the development of markets and products, and
improve a country’s infrastructure. Portfolio flows can reduce the cost of
capital, improve competitiveness, and increase investment opportunities.
Bank flows can strengthen domestic financial institutions, improve financial
intermediation, and reduce vulnerability to crises.

Overview

| 25

A series of financial crises in emerging market economies, however, has
raised some concerns that financial liberalization can also involve risks. In
countries with weak institutions, poorly regulated banking systems, or high
levels of corruption, capital inflows may not be channeled to their most
productive uses. One approach to limiting the risks from capital flows when
legal and financial institutions are poorly developed is to restrict foreign
capital inflows. Experience suggests, however, that capital controls impose
substantial, and often unexpected, costs. Instead, countries are more likely to
benefit from free capital flows and minimize any related risks, if they adopt
prudent fiscal and monetary policies, strengthen financial and corporate
institutions, and develop sound regulations and supervisory agencies. The
Administration has promoted policies to help countries reap the benefits
from the free flow of international capital.
Chapter 14, The Link Between Trade and Capital Flows, shows that trade
flows and capital flows are inherently intertwined. Changes in a country’s net
international trade in goods and services, captured by the current account,
must be reflected in equal and opposite changes in its net capital flows with
the rest of the world. The large net inflow of foreign capital experienced by
the United States in recent years has funded more investment than could be
supported by U.S. national saving. Corresponding to these inflows is the large
U.S. current account deficit. These patterns reflect fundamental economic
forces, notably strong growth in the United States that has made investment
in this country attractive compared to opportunities in other countries.
An adjustment of the U.S. current account deficit could come about in
several ways. Faster growth in other countries relative to the United States
could increase demand for U.S. net exports. Trade flows could also adjust
through changes in the relative prices of U.S. goods and services compared
to the prices of foreign goods and services. Any narrowing of the U.S.
current account deficit would also require reduced net capital inflows into
the United States. This might occur if U.S. national saving increased,
reducing the need for foreign funds to finance U.S. domestic investment, or
if U.S. investment declined, so that the United States required less capital
inflows. Lower investment is the least desirable form of balance of payments
adjustment, however, as it could slow the expansion of U.S. productive
capacity and reduce economic growth.
It is impossible to predict the exact timing or magnitude of any adjustment
in the U.S. current account balance. After a large increase in the U.S. current
account deficit in the 1980s, the ensuing adjustments were gradual and
benign. Public policies can facilitate smooth changes in the U.S. current
account and net capital flows by creating a stable macroeconomic and financial environment, promoting growth abroad, and encouraging greater saving
in the United States.
26 | Economic Report of the President

Conclusion
The future of the U.S. economy is bright. This is a testament to the
institutions and policies that have unleashed the creativity of the American
people and their spirit of entrepreneurship. History teaches that the forces
of free markets are the bedrock of economic prosperity.
In 1776, as the Founding Fathers signed the Declaration of Independence,
the great economist Adam Smith wrote: “Little else is requisite to carry a state
to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism but peace, easy
taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice: all the rest being brought
about by the natural course of things.” The economic analysis presented in
this Report builds on the ideas of Smith and his intellectual descendants by
discussing the role of the government in creating an environment that
promotes and sustains economic growth.

Lessons from the Recent Business Cycle

E

conomic conditions in the United States improved substantially during
2003, with real gross domestic product (GDP), the most comprehensive
measure of the output of the U.S. economy, expanding at an annual rate of
more than 8 percent in the third quarter of the year. Based on data available
through the middle of January, a further solid gain appears likely in the fourth
quarter (the GDP estimate for the fourth quarter was released after this Report
went to press). The improvement in the economy over the course of the year
stemmed largely from faster growth in household consumption, extraordinary
gains in residential investment, and a sharp acceleration of investment in equipment and software by businesses. Payroll employment bottomed out in July and
increased 278,000 over the remainder of the year. Financial markets responded
favorably to the strengthening of the economy, with the total value of the stock
market rising more than $3 trillion, or 31 percent, over the course of 2003.
Despite this improvement, the U.S. economy has further to go to make up
for the weakness that began showing even before the economy slipped into
recession roughly three years ago. Until recently, the recovery has been slow
and uneven. Employment has lagged behind gains in other areas. Strong fiscal
policy actions by this Administration and the Congress, together with the
Federal Reserve’s stimulative monetary policy, have softened the impact of the
recession and have also put the economy on an upward trajectory. The
Administration’s pro-growth tax policy, in particular, has laid the groundwork
for sustainable rapid growth in the years ahead.
This chapter discusses the distinctive features of the recent recession and
recovery, and it draws lessons for the future. The key points in this chapter are:
• Structural imbalances, such as the “capital overhang” that developed in
the late 1990s, can take some time to resolve.
• Uncertainty matters for economic decisions, and was likely a factor
weighing on investment in recent years.
• Aggressive monetary policy can reduce the depth of a recession.
• Tax cuts can boost economic activity by raising after-tax income and
enhancing incentives to work, save, and invest.
• Strong productivity growth raises standards of living but means that
much faster economic growth is needed to raise employment.

29

Overview of the Recent Business Cycle
The recent recession and recovery mark the seventh business cycle in the
U.S. economy since 1960. This cycle shares some common features with
previous business cycles. According to the National Bureau of Economic
Research (NBER), the unofficial arbiter of U.S. business cycles, a recession is
“a period of falling economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more
than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment,
industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales.” The recent recession, like
others, has involved a downturn in economic activity of sufficient depth,
duration, and breadth to be judged a recession by the NBER.
The NBER also identifies the peaks and troughs of economic activity that
mark when recessions begin and end. In November 2001, the NBER determined that the economy had peaked in March 2001. However, revisions to
economic data since the NBER’s initial decision suggest that the peak in
activity was actually months earlier (Box 1-1). In July 2003, the NBER
determined that the economy had reached a trough in November 2001.
Despite the similarities between the recent business cycle and previous
ones, this most recent cycle was distinctive in important and instructive
ways. One noteworthy difference is that real GDP fell much less in this
recession than has been typical. Chart 1-1 shows the path of real GDP over
the past several years compared with the average path of the six prior recessions, with the level of real GDP at the economy’s peak set equal to 100 in
each case. (All of the charts in this Report assume that the peak for the recent
recession was in the fourth quarter of 2000.) The chart shows that the
decline in real GDP in the recent recession was smaller than the historical
average; indeed, it was the second smallest in any recession since 1960.

Box 1-1: When Did the Recent Recession Begin?
The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) uses a variety of
economic data to determine the dates of business-cycle peaks and
troughs. This task is made more difficult because many of these data
series are subject to revision. For example, on November 26, 2001, the
NBER announced that a recession had begun in March 2001. Since
then, the four data series that the NBER used to determine the timing
of the recession have been revised. The revisions to these series
suggest that the recent recession began earlier than March 2001.
The four series cited by the NBER in their decision about the recent
business-cycle peak were revised as follows:

30 | Economic Report of the President

Box 1-1 — continued
• Real personal income less transfers: When the NBER dated the
recession, this series showed a generally steady rise throughout
2000 and early 2001. Subsequent revisions reveal that income
peaked in October 2000.
• Nonfarm payroll employment: The data at the time of the
recession announcement showed employment growing at a
substantial pace in early 2001, with 287,000 jobs added from
December 2000 to its peak in March 2001. Revised data show that
employment grew less than one-third of this amount in early 2001
and peaked in February 2001.
• Industrial production: The original data used by the NBER showed
that this series peaked in September 2000. Revised data show that
this peak came even earlier, in June 2000.
• Manufacturing and trade sales: Original data showed a peak in
August 2000; the most recent data show a peak in June 2000.
Thus, the revised data show that the latest peak among the four
series was February 2001, with some series peaking considerably
earlier. Moreover, another data series, which the NBER has recently
announced it will incorporate into its business-cycle dating process,
also shows a peak before March 2001: monthly GDP reached a high
point in February 2001, according to the most recently available
estimates computed by a private economic consulting firm.
While some arbitrariness in determining the date on which a recession
began is inevitable, revisions since the NBER made its decision for the
most recent recession strongly suggest that the business-cycle peak
was before March 2001. The median date of the peak for the five series
discussed here is October 2000. Other data support the notion that
economic activity had slowed sharply or even begun to decline by this
point, including the stock market, business investment, and initial
unemployment claims. For these reasons, the analyses throughout
this chapter (including the charts that compare this recession to past
recessions) use the fourth quarter of 2000 as the peak of economic
activity and the start of the recession.
In October 2003, the NBER announced that it would defer consideration
of whether the latest business-cycle peak should be revised until the
results of the coming comprehensive revision of the National Income
and Product Accounts were released. The major results of this revision
were announced in December 2003, but the monthly manufacturing
and trade sales data and some of the detail needed to estimate monthly
GDP had not been released at the time this Report went to press.

Chapter 1

This relatively mild decline in output can be attributed to unusually
resilient household spending. Consumer spending on goods and services
held up well throughout the slowdown, and investment in housing increased
at a fairly steady pace rather than declining as has been typical in past recessions. In contrast, business investment in capital equipment and structures
has been quite soft in this cycle. As discussed below, business spending
during the past few years has likely been held down by overinvestment in the
late 1990s, as well as by heightened business caution owing to terrorism and
corporate scandals. As a result of these forces, investment weakened sooner
and has recovered more slowly than in the typical cycle.
Another distinguishing feature of this cycle has been the weakness in labor
markets relative to output. In particular, the recovery in employment—
although now under way—lagged the upturn in output by a much longer
period than in prior recessions. This difference was associated with unusually
large productivity gains.
The balance of this chapter draws five distinctive lessons from the recent
business cycle in the United States. Chapter 3, The Year in Review and the
Years Ahead, presents details about developments over the past year and
discusses the Administration’s forecast.
32 | Economic Report of the President

Lesson 1: Structural Imbalances
Can Take Some Time to Resolve
Business investment in equipment and software surged in the late 1990s.
Real investment increased at an average annual rate of roughly 13 percent
between the fourth quarter of 1994 and the fourth quarter of 1999, compared
with an average annual rate of less than 7 percent over the preceding three
decades. The surge in investment was led by purchases of high-tech capital
goods—computers, software, and communications equipment—which
increased at an average annual rate of 20 percent over the period.
Economic theory implies that businesses invest when they believe that
there are profits to be made from that investment. In the late 1990s, several
developments fed a perception that the expected future return from newly
installed capital would be considerably greater than the cost of this capital.
Rapid advances in technology had lowered the price of high-tech capital
goods dramatically throughout the 1990s and especially in the second half
of the decade. For example, the quality-adjusted price index for business
computers and peripheral equipment fell at an average annual rate of
22 percent between late 1994 and late 1999. In addition, rapidly growing
demand for business output led firms to believe that newly installed capital
would be used productively, boosting the expected return to investment.
Moreover, technological progress and legislation provided incentives for
strong investment in high-tech equipment. The development of the World
Wide Web enabled new and established firms to enter e-commerce, and
rapidly increasing household and business access to the Internet provided a
large base of potential customers for these firms. The Telecommunications
Act of 1996 provided for substantial deregulation of the telecommunications industry and may have spurred investment in that sector. In addition,
concern that some computer systems might be inoperable after December
1999 caused a wave of so-called Y2K-related investment. Some analysis indicates that Y2K spending alone boosted the growth rate of real equipment
and software investment by more than 31⁄2 percentage points per year in the
latter part of the 1990s.
Optimism about the potential gains from new capital, and from high-tech
capital in particular, was reflected not only in investment decisions but also
in a sharp rise in stock prices. From late 1994 to late 1999, the Wilshire
5000—a broad index of U.S. stock prices—nearly tripled. The Nasdaq stock
price index, which is heavily weighted toward high-tech industries, registered
an even more dramatic ascent, increasing more than fourfold over this period.
The increase in stock prices stimulated investment by reducing the cost of
equity capital. In addition, the rise in stock prices fueled a consumption
boom by boosting the wealth of a growing number of Americans and more
Chapter 1

| 33

generally signaling better future economic conditions. This consumption
boom encouraged further business investment.
In mid-2000, business equipment investment abruptly slowed. After rising
at an annual rate of 15 percent in the first half of the year, real spending on
business equipment and software inched up at about a 1⁄4 percent annual rate
in the second half. The slowdown in high-tech equipment investment was
especially dramatic. For example, real outlays for computers had skyrocketed
at an annual rate of 40 percent in the first half of the year, but grew at less than
one-quarter of that pace in the second half. This stalling of investment
preceded the downturn in the overall economy; by contrast, in the typical
business cycle, investment has turned down at the same time as overall
economic activity (Chart 1-2). The unusual timing of the investment slowdown in this recession is the reason that the recent business cycle has been
widely viewed as an “investment-led” recession.
The sharp break in investment occurred in parallel with an apparent
reevaluation of future corporate profitability among financial market participants. By the end of 2000, the Wilshire 5000 index of stock prices was
down 13 percent from its peak, and analysts had substantially marked down
their forecasts for S&P 500 earnings over the coming year. The movements
were even more dramatic in the high-tech sector. The Nasdaq index of stock

34 | Economic Report of the President

prices dropped nearly 50 percent from its peak in March 2000 to the end of
the year. The prices of technology, telecommunications, and Internet shares
fell particularly sharply, along with near-term earnings estimates. The
elevated valuations of many such companies also declined markedly. Indeed,
the price-earnings ratio (where “earnings” are those expected over the next
year) for the technology component of the S&P 500 fell from a peak of
more than 50 in early 2000 to less than 35 by the end of the year.
These facts and considerable anecdotal evidence suggest that business
managers and investors sharply revised downward the expected gains from
new capital investment during this period. One factor that may have
contributed to the downward revision is a possible slowing of the pace of
technological advance—the rate at which computer prices were declining
eased (from more than 20 percent in the late 1990s to about half that in
2000), and the software industry reportedly developed no new so-called
“killer applications” that required or spurred purchases of new hardware. In
addition, firms may have been disappointed by the response of households to
e-commerce opportunities and to new communications technologies such as
broadband. Finally, previous investments had not uniformly translated into
higher profitability, perhaps because the true potential of new forms of capital
could be realized only by changing other aspects of production processes. For
example, new computer systems designed to lower inventory management
costs might have required an expensive reconfiguration of warehouses.
This reassessment of the gains from capital investment also implied that
existing stocks of some types of equipment exceeded the amount of equipment that firms could put to profitable use. Such an excess of the existing
capital stock relative to the desired stock (often called a capital overhang) is
one type of structural imbalance that can slow or reverse economic expansion. In the case of an excess supply of capital, investment would be expected
to slow until the capital overhang dissipates through a combination of
depreciation in the existing stock and an increase in the desired stock due to
lower costs of capital or stronger final demand.
Resolving the structural imbalance that developed in the late 1990s took
considerable time. Real business spending on equipment and software
dropped more than 9 percent during the four quarters of 2001 and posted
less than a 2 percent gain during the four quarters of 2002. The high-tech
categories showed especially sharp breaks in their upward trends. In these
categories, the effects of the capital overhang were likely exacerbated by a
reduction in normal replacement demand following the Y2K-related investment spurt. The prolonged period of sluggishness in business investment is
another distinctive feature of this business cycle. Real investment in equipment and software typically has fallen less and has recovered more quickly
than it did in the current recession and recovery (Chart 1-2).

Chapter 1

| 35

A similar structural adjustment appears to have taken place overseas,
where investment demand was also weak. The global slowdown in investment hampered U.S. export growth, since capital goods traditionally
account for about one-third of the value of U.S. exports. Real exports fell
sharply in this recession and have recovered only a little of their lost ground.
In past recessions, exports have typically leveled off but not declined
(Chart 1-3). Soft investment and weak export demand led to a long period
of weakness in manufacturing output, a topic discussed in the next chapter.
Several forces have more recently moved existing capital stocks into better
alignment with desired stocks and thereby set the stage for a renewal of
robust investment demand. Previously installed capital has depreciated, a
process that occurs especially quickly for many types of high-tech equipment. Rising demand for business output and falling costs for high-tech
capital (caused by ongoing technological progress) have increased firms’
desired capital stocks. The elimination of capital overhangs, together with
improved business confidence and reductions in tax rates on capital income
discussed later in this chapter, are consistent with the marked upturn in
business investment spending in the second half of 2003.

Lesson 2: Uncertainty Matters
for Economic Decisions
The U.S. economy has been hit hard in the past few years by a number of
unexpected developments, including the tragic terrorist attacks of September
11, 2001, the corporate governance and accounting scandals of 2002, and the
geopolitical tensions surrounding the war with Iraq in 2003. In addition to
having direct effects on the economy, each of these events contributed to a
climate of uncertainty that weighed on household and business confidence
and thereby affected spending decisions.
The terrorist attacks have had substantial consequences for many aspects of
the U.S. economy. The heightened focus on security at home, together with
the determined efforts against terrorism around the world, have required
increases in some types of government spending. The attacks hurt some
industries directly: for example, fear of new attacks and the inconveniences
associated with heightened airport security reduced air travel and tourism.
Beyond these direct economic effects, the unprecedented attacks on the
United States also generated uncertainty about future economic conditions.
Another setback for the economy was the series of revelations during 2002
regarding incomplete or misleading corporate financial reporting and, in some
cases, wrongful conduct by corporate management. The number of financial
restatements—that is, corrections to previous statements of earnings—by U.S.
public corporations reached a record high in 2002. Although most of the
restatements were not linked to misconduct, they raised questions about the
reliability of accounting practices and the credibility of corporate financial
disclosures. The combination of these concerns and allegations of misconduct
by high-profile executives heightened investors’ uncertainty about the quality
of corporate governance and the reliability of earnings reports and projections.
In early 2003, uncertainty about the economic outlook increased during
the period leading up to the war with Iraq. One source of this uncertainty
was the potential effect of the conflict on the capacity for producing and
transporting oil in the Persian Gulf, and thus on the future supply and price
of oil. Observers were also concerned about the amount of additional government spending that would be needed to finance military operations and
subsequent reconstruction, as well as the danger of retaliatory terrorist attacks
on the United States. Finally, consumer confidence fell sharply in early 2003,
raising concerns that the consumer demand that had supported the economy
over the previous couple of years might falter. Such concerns were plausible,
given that the 1990 Gulf War roughly coincided with a marked drop in
consumer confidence and the start of the 1990-1991 recession.

Chapter 1

| 37

The uncertainties created by the three developments described above had
significant effects on financial markets. Stock prices dipped noticeably in
September 2001, recovered subsequently, but moved down during the
summer of 2002 and fell again in early 2003 (Chart 1-4). Risk spreads (the
difference between interest rates on corporate bonds and on comparable
Treasury bonds) jumped temporarily after the terrorist attacks and rose again
in late 2002 during the peak of concerns about corporate governance.
Because risk spreads generally reflect the extra return investors require to
hold riskier corporate assets, the rise in spreads in 2002 indicated investors’
greater perceived probability of default, lesser willingness to take on risk, or
both. Investor uncertainty also was reflected in measures of the expected
volatility of stock prices based on option prices, which were elevated during
each of the episodes noted above (Chart 1-5).
Reductions in share prices and increases in bond yields raised the cost of
funding capital expenditures and thus directly discouraged business investment. Increased uncertainty likely also had direct effects on business
decisions about investment and hiring: uncertainty may cause firms to wait
until they have more information before committing to an investment. In
this case, firm managers hesitate to respond to a change in demand.
Anecdotal evidence from the past few years as well as some statistical analyses

38 | Economic Report of the President

suggest that uncertainty has a noticeable damping effect on investment.
Anecdotal evidence also suggests that uncertainty has held back hiring in the
past few years.
Household spending may also have been affected by uncertainty.
Economic theory and empirical evidence suggest that greater uncertainty
about future economic conditions may lead households to raise saving and
reduce spending. However, such effects are not immediately apparent in the
recent cyclical downturn—as will be explained shortly, household spending
has shown remarkable resiliency over the past few years. A possible explanation for the seeming discrepancy between this pattern and empirical work
based on earlier data is that the negative effects of greater uncertainty were
offset by lower taxes and the effects of lower interest rates.
While the uncertainty created by these unexpected developments has
hampered the economic recovery, household and business confidence strengthened considerably during the second half of 2003. This Administration and
the Congress moved swiftly to address problems with corporate governance.
In March 2002, the President proposed a set of reforms aimed at a wide
range of corporate governance issues, and in July 2002, Congress passed the
landmark Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As concerns about corporate governance
have abated, and the durability of the recovery has become more apparent,
firms have begun to invest and hire.

Chapter 1

Lesson 3: Aggressive Monetary Policy Can
Reduce the Depth of a Recession
When the economy showed signs of weakening three years ago, the
Federal Reserve moved decisively to reduce interest rates to stimulate the
economy. During 2001, the Federal Reserve cut the Federal funds rate
eleven times for a total reduction of 43⁄4 percentage points. When the
economy failed to gain much forward momentum, the Federal Reserve
reduced the funds rate another 1⁄2 percentage point in November 2002 and a
further 1⁄4 percentage point last June, to 1 percent. The decline in the Federal
funds rate in this economic downturn was larger and occurred more rapidly
than in previous downturns (Chart 1-6). One factor that likely contributed
to the Federal Reserve’s willingness to cut the funds rate so sharply was the
low level of inflation. Core consumer price inflation, as measured by the
12-month change in the consumer price index excluding food and energy,
was around 23⁄4 percent in early 2001 and fell to just over 1 percent by late
last year. Thus, the Federal Reserve was able to lower the Federal funds rate
and keep it low with little apparent risk of triggering an undesirably high
inflation rate.

40 | Economic Report of the President

Long-term interest rates on government securities and high-grade corporate
securities began falling in late 2000, likely in part reflecting an anticipated
decline in the Federal funds rate in response to a weaker economic outlook.
Throughout 2001, short-term and medium-term interest rates declined
along with the Federal funds rate. However, long-term rates changed little, on
net, because market participants apparently expected the downturn to be
short-lived and believed that the Federal Reserve would soon begin raising
the funds rate. Then, in 2002, persistently weak economic conditions,
combined with the Federal Reserve’s decisions to hold the funds rate steady
for much of the year and cut it further in November, persuaded market
participants that short-term rates were likely to stay low for some time. As a
result, long-term rates fell substantially, on balance, in 2002. Long-term rates
fluctuated in 2003, but finished the year a little above where they started.
Interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages tracked long-term government
yields over this period, as they typically have. In 2003, the interest rate on
30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged more than 2 percentage points below
the average in 2000. Low and falling mortgage rates have provided strong
support for housing demand over the past few years. Indeed, residential
investment has increased at a fairly steady pace throughout the period of
overall economic weakness—a stark contrast to the pattern in past recessions,
when residential investment tended to fall sharply (Chart 1-7).

Chapter 1

| 41

Declining mortgage interest rates have also fueled an enormous wave of
mortgage refinancing. (The response has been particularly strong because
technological and institutional advances in mortgage markets have reduced
the costs of such transactions.) In many refinancing transactions, homeowners have “cashed out” some of their accumulated home equity by taking
out new mortgages that are larger than the remaining balance on their
previous mortgages. According to a survey of households, more than half of
the liquefied equity funded either home renovations or household consumption and thus may have helped to sustain aggregate demand. Another
substantial portion reportedly was used to pay down credit card debt, which
generally carries a higher interest rate than mortgage debt and, unlike mortgage debt, is not tax-deductible. By moving from a high-cost form of debt
to a lower-cost one, households have been better able to cope with their debt
burdens. In particular, the transition has held down the fraction of their
income committed to regular debt service payments, and thus has increased
the amount of income available for spending on discretionary items.
Low long-term interest rates have also reduced the cost of funds to
businesses. In some cases, this lower cost has been passed directly to households. For example, motor vehicle manufacturers made low-interest-rate
loans available to car buyers in late 2001 and have generally maintained a
high level of financing incentives since then. These incentives have bolstered
consumer outlays for motor vehicles.
More generally, lower interest rates make it cheaper for firms to finance
new investment projects. The aggressive easing of monetary policy since
early 2001 has likely helped to support business investment, even though
the forces discussed earlier have, on balance, caused investment to be weak.
Firms have also taken advantage of low long-term interest rates to restructure their balance sheets. Net issuance of commercial paper and net
borrowing from banks were both negative in each of the past three years,
while net bond issuance was strong. By issuing longer-term bonds and paying
down short-term debt, businesses have substantially lengthened the overall
maturity of their debt. This restructuring reduced firms’ near-term repayment
obligations and locked in low rates for longer periods. The strengthening of
businesses’ financial positions means that financial constraints are less likely
to restrain a further pickup in hiring and investment.

42 | Economic Report of the President

Lesson 4: Tax Cuts Can Boost Economic
Activity by Raising After-Tax Income and
Enhancing Incentives to Work, Save, and Invest
The use of discretionary fiscal policy—explicit changes in taxes and government
spending, as opposed to those that occur automatically as economic activity
changes—to reduce cyclical fluctuations in the economy has fallen out of
favor with many economists over the past several decades. Some have
pointed to the difficulties of crafting and implementing discretionary policy
quickly enough to provide stimulus while the economy is still weak rather
than accentuating an upturn that is already under way. It has also been noted
that a temporary reduction in taxes might be mostly saved by households
and thus encourage relatively little additional spending. Moreover, some
have argued that expansionary fiscal policy can push up interest rates and
thereby “crowd out” interest-sensitive spending. All told, before the recent
business cycle, many economists believed that monetary policy made the use
of discretionary fiscal policy unnecessary to stabilize the economy.
The experience of the past three years, however, shows that well-designed
and well-timed tax cuts are a useful complement to expansionary monetary
policy. Over this period, three bills have made significant changes to the
personal and corporate tax systems. The President came into office with
proposals for permanently reducing taxes on work and saving. With the
budget surplus having reached its highest level relative to GDP in half a
century, the proposals were aimed predominantly at reducing tax-based
impediments to long-term growth. The proposals resulted in the Economic
Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (EGTRRA), which the President
signed into law in June 2001. In the wake of the terrorist attacks of
September 2001 and continuing softness in the economy, the Congress
passed the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act (JCWAA), which the
President signed into law in March 2002. And, in early 2003, with the pace
of economic growth still falling below its potential and the labor market
lagging behind, the President proposed and the Congress enacted the Jobs
and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (JGTRRA), which the President
signed into law in May.
These three bills provided substantial short-term stimulus to economic
activity and helped put the economy on the road to recovery. One source of
stimulus has been the large boost to after-tax personal income stemming
from lower marginal tax rates, a larger child tax credit, reduced tax rates on
dividends and capital gains, and other changes in the tax law. Real after-tax
income has increased much more than before-tax income over the past three

Chapter 1

| 43

years (Chart 1-8). Over the preceding five years, average annual growth in
real after-tax income was more than 1⁄2 percentage point below the growth
rate of real before-tax income. Numerous studies have shown that long-term
tax cuts foster higher consumer spending. Thus, the additional income
provided by the tax cuts is likely to have substantially boosted aggregate
demand since 2000.
The tax cuts provided further stimulus by increasing incentives for business
investment. Some of these incentives came in the form of bonus depreciation
for business investment, an expansion in the amount of expensing of investment available for small businesses. The bonus depreciation was introduced
in the 2002 tax cut (JCWAA), which specified that 30 percent of the price
of investments made by September 10, 2004 could be treated as an immediate expense under the corporate profits tax and the remaining 70 percent
depreciated over time according to the regular depreciation schedules.
Moving the depreciation closer to the time of new investment increased the
present value of depreciation allowances and the net after-tax return on
investment. The 2003 tax cut (JGTRRA) raised the bonus depreciation to

44 | Economic Report of the President

50 percent of the price of new equipment and extended the period of
eligibility so that investments made by the end of 2004 would be covered. It
also increased the cap on small-business expensing from $25,000 to
$100,000 per year through 2005, effectively lowering the cost of investment
for small businesses. These tax changes lowered firms’ cost of capital and
likely provided support for investment at a crucial time.
The tax cuts also reduced the cost of capital and increased incentives for
business investment by lowering tax rates on personal capital income. The
2001 tax cut (EGTRRA) phased out the estate tax and reduced marginal tax
rates on all forms of income. These steps lowered the tax burden on capital
income received from corporations and also on income received through
sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S corporations (corporations for
which income is taxed through individual tax returns). In addition, the 2003
tax cut (JGTRRA) reduced taxes on corporate dividends and capital gains.
Altogether, these three tax bills provided $68 billion in tax stimulus in
fiscal year 2001, $89 billion in fiscal year 2002, $159 billion in fiscal year
2003, and $272 billion in fiscal year 2004. However, the bills were designed
not only to provide short-term stimulus, but also to encourage stronger
economic growth over the long run. Lower tax rates on labor income
provide an incentive to increase work effort. Lower tax rates on capital
income—the reward for saving and investment—provide an incentive to do
more of these activities. Investment increases the amount of capital for each
worker and also increases the rate at which new technology embodied in
capital can be put to use. According to one study, the cut in taxes on capital
income in the 2003 tax package (JGTRRA) reduced the marginal effective
total tax rate on income from corporate investment by 2 to 4 percentage
points. Lower taxes on dividends and capital gains also move the tax system
toward a more equal treatment of debt and equity, of dividends and capital
gains, and of corporate and noncorporate capital. This move increases
economic efficiency because it promotes the allocation of capital based on
business fundamentals rather than a desire for tax avoidance.
In sum, the tax cuts supported by this Administration provided a substantial
short-term stimulus to consumption and investment and promoted strong
and sustainable long-term growth. In weighing the merits of countercyclical
monetary and fiscal policy, the stimulus provided by discretionary fiscal
policy may be especially important in the low-inflation, low-interest-rate
environment the country now enjoys. Under these circumstances, the
Federal Reserve may have less room to cut interest rates, and direct stimulus
to demand from fiscal policy may be needed to ensure that the Nation’s
resources are fully utilized in the face of cyclical weakness.

Lesson 5: Strong Productivity Growth Raises
Standards of Living but Means that
Much Faster Economic Growth is
Needed to Raise Employment
One distinctive feature of this recession and recovery has been the
remarkably fast growth of labor productivity—the amount of goods and
services that a worker with given skills produces from each hour of work.
The late 1990s had already witnessed an acceleration of productivity growth
from an average annual rate of around 11⁄2 percent between the fourth quarters of 1972 and 1995 to a roughly 21⁄2 percent rate between the fourth
quarters of 1995 and 2000. Productivity growth then picked up further,
contrary to the usual experience in which productivity growth has typically
softened in the quarters surrounding business-cycle peaks. In the latest recession, productivity growth leveled off for just one quarter before beginning
to rise rapidly (Chart 1-9). Since the fourth quarter of 2000, productivity
has increased at an exceptional annual rate of more than 4 percent per year.
Labor productivity growth can be decomposed into the skills of the workforce (labor quality), increases in the amount of capital services per
worker-hour (capital deepening), and increases in total factor productivity—a

46 | Economic Report of the President

residual category that captures the change in aggregate output not explained
by changes in capital and labor inputs. According to this framework (as
detailed in last year’s Report), productivity growth stepped up in the mid1990s partly because the rapid pace of business investment generated large
increases in the amount of capital available to each worker. Yet a larger part
of this acceleration owes to faster growth in the unexplained residual
category of total factor productivity.
The explanation for faster productivity growth in the past couple of years
is not clear (especially since the information needed to decompose productivity growth over this period is quite limited). One possibility is that weaker
profits and skepticism about the return to new physical investment have
encouraged firms to make better use of the resources they already had rather
than investing in new technology and capacity. This effort to increase what
is sometimes called organizational capital might involve, for example,
restructuring production processes and retraining workers to take maximum
advantage of new information-technology equipment installed in the late
1990s. Another possibility is that firms somehow induced extra work effort
for a time because they were hesitant to hire new workers until they were
more confident that increases in final demand would persist. A third possibility is that the slower recent pace of gross investment may have been
accompanied by slower depreciation of the existing capital stock so that
firms lengthened replacement cycles and held on to their existing equipment
for longer periods. If this were the case, net investment and the growth rate
of the capital stock would have been stronger than indicated by measures
based on historical depreciation rates.
In the long run, productivity growth is the key determinant of growth in
living standards. Without labor productivity growth, our nation’s output
and income would grow only at the rate at which the labor force expands; if
the labor force grows proportionally with population, this would mean that
income per person would be unchanged. With productivity growth, income
per person increases. Indeed, U.S. average income is close to eight times as
high as it was one hundred years ago, similar to the increase in productivity
over this period. The recent robust gains in productivity have boosted both
corporate profits and employees’ compensation. Corporate profits declined
sharply during the recession, but turned around and rose briskly in 2003
(based on data through the first three quarters). Average hourly earnings of
production workers in private industry have risen at an average annual rate
of close to 3 percent over the past three years. Moreover, productivity growth
has reduced inflationary pressures by holding down growth in unit labor
costs. As a result, wage gains after adjusting for inflation have been even
more impressive by historical standards. In this recession, real average hourly
earnings, published in the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment release,
never fell below their pre-recession levels, and increased nearly 3 percent in
Chapter 1

| 47

the eleven quarters after the recession began. The experiences in past recessions
have been diverse, but many show a net decline in real hourly earnings or
much weaker growth even eleven quarters after the start of the recession.
By definition, labor productivity multiplied by hours worked equals
output. Thus, in an arithmetic sense, faster productivity growth generally
implies that output must expand more rapidly to generate employment
gains. The same principle explains why the rapid pace of productivity
growth over the past couple of years has meant that gains in output occurred
without gains in employment, until recently.
Indeed, the performance of employment over the past couple of years has
been appreciably weaker than in past business cycles (Chart 1-10).
Employment was slow to pick up in the average previous recovery, perhaps
because employers delayed hiring until they became confident that the
increases in demand were sustainable. However, such sluggishness typically
has been short-lived (a quarter or two) and followed by vigorous expansion.
In contrast, in the current business cycle, employment did not begin its
recovery until nearly two years after the upturn in real GDP. The performance of employment in this cycle has lagged even that of the so-called “jobless
recovery” from the 1990-1991 recession. (Chart 1-10 shows data from the
establishment survey done by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The BLS
household survey can show a different pattern—as it has done over the past
couple of years. As discussed in Box 1-2, however, the BLS views the establishment survey as a more accurate indicator of labor market conditions.)

48 | Economic Report of the President

Nonetheless, one should not conclude that rapid productivity growth
causes low employment growth. Rapid productivity growth means that
output must increase faster for employment to expand, but it also means that
the economy is capable of growing faster. In the long run, the faster rate of
potential output growth is undoubtedly a good thing for living standards.

Box 1-2: Two Surveys of Employment
Everyone who works is either employed by a firm or is self-employed.
Therefore, to count the total number of workers, one could ask each
person whether he or she is employed, or one could ask each firm how
many workers it employs. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency
responsible for tracking employment, uses both approaches. When the
BLS asks individuals about their employment status, the results are
summarized in the household survey of employment. When the BLS asks
firms, it produces the establishment survey of employment.
Though both surveys ask about employment, they have some
important differences that can cause their results to diverge. For
example, the establishment survey obtains data from about 160,000
businesses and government agencies that represent about 400,000
worksites and employ over 40 million workers. The sample covers
about one-third of all nonfarm payroll jobs in America. The household
survey, in contrast, collects data from about 60,000 households,
thereby directly covering fewer than 100,000 workers. The establishment survey’s larger base of respondents means the calculated margin
of error of its estimates is significantly smaller than that associated
with the household survey estimates. In addition, the establishment
survey is revised annually to match complete payroll records from the
universe of establishments participating in state unemployment insurance
programs, while the household survey is not.
Furthermore, definitional differences affect the scope of employment
measured by the surveys. The establishment survey estimate represents the number of payroll jobs, or the number of jobs for which
firms pay compensation, while the household survey estimate represents the number of employed persons. Because some people hold
more than one job, the total number of payroll jobs can exceed the
total number of employed persons. On the other hand, the household
survey includes employees working in the agricultural sector, the
unincorporated self-employed, unpaid family workers, workers in
private households, and workers on unpaid leave from their jobs. The
establishment survey excludes all of these categories because they
are not reported on the nonfarm business payrolls that provide the
source data for the survey.

Chapter 1

| 49

Box 1-2 — continued
These differences and other factors create a gap between the
household and establishment surveys’ employment estimates,
though they tend to display similar long-term trends. The average gap
since 1990 has been about 6 percent, or 8 million workers.
While long-term trends in the two surveys are similar, over shorter
periods of time their trends have sometimes diverged. This has been the
case since late 2001, when employment from the two surveys has
trended in opposite directions. For the first time in the two series’ histories, one showed a large and sustained decrease in employment while
the other showed a large and sustained increase. In particular, the establishment survey reported a decline in employment of over 1.0 million
from the end of the recession in November 2001 to August 2003, while
the household survey reported an increase of over 1.4 million. In every
month of 2003, the establishment survey showed employment below
the November 2001 level, while the household survey showed it above
this level. Such a sustained string of divergence is unprecedented.
One possible explanation is that the establishment survey misses
some new firms and therefore may underestimate employment at the
start of an economic expansion. Past revisions to the establishment
survey offer some support for this theory. For the recent data,
however, this theory can explain at most the divergence since March
2003, because establishment survey data up to that point appear
consistent with unemployment insurance records that cover all establishments. Another possible explanation is that the household survey
results are overstated because of the way in which the survey results
are extrapolated to represent the entire population. Specifically, information from the 2000 Census, together with estimates of how the
population is changing over time, are used to determine how many
actual U.S. households correspond to each household in the sample.
If, for example, immigration has been unexpectedly low because of
tighter border controls and the weaker labor market over the past few
years, the estimated number of U.S. households corresponding to
each household in the sample may be overstated. As a result, the estimates of total employment (and other aggregates based on the
population estimates) from the household survey could be too high.
Both surveys contain valuable information about current economic
developments, but, as with all economic statistics, the data from both
surveys are imperfect. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has stated that the
establishment survey is generally the more reliable indicator of current
trends in employment. Still, the explanation for why these two surveys’
results have diverged so markedly over the last few years, and what this
might indicate about the economic recovery, remains a puzzle.

Conclusion
The U.S. economy is much stronger now than it was a year ago and, as
will be discussed in Chapter 3, prospects for the coming year look solid.
Nonetheless, the experiences of the past several years remain relevant for the
future. Understanding the negative forces that weighed against the economy,
as well as the policies that contributed to the recovery, can help policy
makers ensure that economic activity maintains a strong upward trend in
the years ahead.

The Manufacturing Sector

T

he manufacturing sector was affected by the latest economic slowdown
earlier, longer, and harder than other sectors of the economy and only
recently have manufacturing employment losses begun to abate. Over the past
several decades, the manufacturing sector has experienced substantial output
growth, even while manufacturing employment has declined as a share of
total employment. This chapter examines recent developments and long-term
trends in manufacturing and considers policy responses.
The key points in this chapter are:
• The severity of the recent slowdown in manufacturing was largely due to
prolonged weakness in business investment and exports, both of which
are heavily tied to manufacturing.
• The manufacturing employment decline over the past half-century
primarily reflects striking gains in productivity and increasing consumer
demand for services compared to manufactured goods. International
trade plays a relatively small role.
• Consumers and businesses generally benefit from the lower prices made
possible by increased manufacturing productivity, and strong productivity growth has led to real compensation growth for workers. The shift
of jobs from manufacturing to services has caused dislocation but has not
resulted, on balance, in a shift from “good jobs” to “bad jobs.”
• The best response to recent developments in manufacturing is to focus on
stimulating the overall economy and easing restrictions that impede manufacturing growth. This Administration has actively pursued such measures.

Manufacturing and the Recent Business Cycle
This section looks at the characteristics and causes of the recent economic
downturn with particular focus on the manufacturing sector. Output in
manufacturing held up relatively well in the recent recession, but employment
declined sharply. Data released over the past few months are encouraging
regarding the prospects for recovery in the manufacturing sector.

53

The Recent Downturn in Manufacturing Output
Manufacturing output dropped 6.8 percent from its peak in June 2000 to
its trough in December 2001. This was a larger decline than that for real
GDP, which fell only 0.5 percent from its peak in the fourth quarter of 2000
to its trough in the third quarter of 2001. This gap is not out of line with
historical experience: manufacturing output has dropped much more than
real GDP during past business cycles (Chart 2-1). What is more unusual is
that the recovery in manufacturing output has been far weaker than the
recovery in real GDP.
As discussed in Chapter 1, Lessons from the Recent Business Cycle, investment
demand was especially weak during the recent recession. A slowing of
demand for equipment investment disproportionately hurts the manufacturing sector because nearly all business equipment involves manufactured
products. The rest of final demand, in contrast, involves a mix of manufactured goods, agricultural products, services, and structures. The industries
within manufacturing contributing most to the downturn in manufacturing
output were those primarily associated with the production of business
equipment. In particular, slower growth in production of computers and
other electronics, machinery, and metals accounts for nearly two-thirds of
the swing in manufacturing output from its rapid growth in the late 1990s
(an annual rate of 6.9 percent) to its decline in the 18 months after

54 | Economic Report of the President

mid-2000 (an annual rate of -4.6 percent). Some parts of manufacturing saw
especially difficult times. The metalworking machinery industry, of which
the hard-hit tool and die industry makes up 40 percent of employment, has
seen its payrolls decline by almost 25 percent from mid-2000 to the end of
2003. Real production in the metalworking machinery industry fell by more
than 35 percent over this period.
The timing of the manufacturing slowdown also strongly suggests a link
to the decline in business investment (Chart 2-2). Manufacturing output
declined substantially in the middle of 2000, months before real GDP
turned downward around the fourth quarter of 2000. This pattern mirrors
that of business investment in equipment and software, which also peaked
in mid-2000—well before the overall economy. The prolonged period of
weakness in manufacturing output also bears a notable similarity to the
sluggish recovery in investment in equipment and software.
Lackluster demand for U.S. exports has been another source of weakness
in the manufacturing sector over the past three years. Exports have been
depressed, in part due to slow growth in other major economies. Since the
fourth quarter of 2000, the average annual rates of real GDP growth in the
euro area and Japan have been less than half that of the United States.
Industrial supplies and capital goods make up the bulk of U.S. goods
exports. Lower exports of manufactured goods can account for all of the
decline in exports since 2000.

Chapter 2

Manufacturing Employment in Recent Years
Manufacturing employment declined more than manufacturing output
during the recent downturn, just as overall employment declined more than
overall output. Manufacturing employment declined 16 percent from June
2000, the peak of manufacturing production, to December 2003—a steeper
decline than in recessions on average (Chart 2-3). In fact, the recent drop in
manufacturing employment was the largest cyclical decline since 1960.
As with the overall economy, the weakness of manufacturing employment
relative to output during and after the recent recession has been reflected in
rapid productivity growth (Chart 2-4). From the fourth quarter of 2000
through the third quarter of 2003, productivity in the nonfarm business
sector and in the manufacturing sector rose more than 4 percent at an
annual rate—appreciably faster than in recessions on average since 1960.
This rise has allowed businesses to increase output without a corresponding
increase in labor input.

56 | Economic Report of the President

Signs of Recovery in the Manufacturing Sector
Data for the second half of 2003 suggest a noticeable firming in the
manufacturing sector. Orders and shipments of capital goods began to
increase around the middle of 2003. Industrial production rose at an average
annual rate of 5.9 percent during the second half of the year, the largest sixmonth gain since the first half of 2000. In addition, the new orders index
from the Institute of Supply Management’s monthly survey of purchasing
managers rose to its highest level in two decades, indicating widespread optimism that activity is picking up. Moreover, some of the factors that have
historically affected firms’ production decisions support a further strengthening—the cost of capital is low by the standards of the last decade and
manufacturers’ profits are well above their levels of two years ago.
Although manufacturing employment fell throughout 2003, recent developments hint at improving employment conditions for the sector as a whole. To
be sure, some industries continue to lag—for example, textiles, apparel,
printing, and petroleum and coal industries have seen employment fall substantially more than overall manufacturing employment since mid-2003. More

Chapter 2

| 57

broadly, however, the rate of decline in overall manufacturing employment
eased noticeably in the fourth quarter of 2003, with the smallest quarterly loss
in three years. In addition, the rise in temporary-help services since the spring
of 2003 is consistent with a future rebound in permanent employment. The
temporary-help sector supplies a substantial share of its workers to the manufacturing sector, and over the past decade has tended to lead movements in the
permanent payrolls of manufacturing firms (Chart 2-5).

58 | Economic Report of the President

Long-Term Trends
To place the recent experience of the American manufacturing sector in
perspective, this section examines the evolution of the manufacturing sector
as a whole over the 50 years from 1950 to 2000 along three key dimensions:
output, productivity and demand, and employment.

Manufacturing Output over the Long Term
Manufacturing output increased dramatically from 1950 to 2000, with
particularly strong growth in the 1990s (Chart 2-6). Manufacturing industrial production, a measure of real manufacturing output, increased more than
sixfold from 1950 to 2000 before declining in the recent recession. Over the
same period, annual growth in manufacturing industrial production averaged
3.8 percent, faster than real GDP growth of 3.4 percent. From 1990 to 2000,
manufacturing industrial production expanded at an annual rate of 4.6
percent, outpacing real GDP growth by more than a percentage point. Per
capita consumption of manufactured goods has also risen: consumption of
goods excluding food and fuel more than quadrupled in real 2000 dollar
terms from $1,400 per person in 1950 to $6,000 per person in 2000.

Chapter 2

| 59

In contrast to real manufacturing output, nominal manufacturing output
(the dollar value of manufacturing output) has grown more slowly than
nominal GDP (the dollar value of GDP). As a result, the share of nominal
GDP accounted for by manufacturing roughly halved, from 29 percent in
1950 to 15 percent in 2000 (based on GDP by industry data available when
this Report went to press; that is, prior to the 2003 benchmark revision of
the National Income and Product Accounts).

Manufacturing Productivity and Demand over the
Long Term
Two factors are driving the declining share of manufacturing in U.S.
nominal output. First, and most significant, productivity growth in manufacturing lowered the relative price of manufactured goods, but demand did
not respond proportionately. Second, imported manufactured goods
increased their market share.
Productivity, as measured by output per hour worked, has grown more
rapidly in manufacturing than in the overall nonfarm business sector over
the last three decades. From 1950 to 1973, manufacturing productivity grew
at about the same pace as productivity overall. Over the period from 1973
to 1995, manufacturing productivity growth exceeded productivity growth
overall by about 1 percentage point per year. The disparity is even wider over
the period from 1995 to 2000, when manufacturing productivity grew at an
annual rate nearly 2 percentage points higher than nonfarm business
productivity (Chart 2-7). An hour of work in manufacturing produced
about four times as much in 2000 as it did in 1950, whereas an hour of work
in the nonfarm business sector produced less than three times as much in
2000 as it did in 1950.
This dramatic productivity differential has contributed to a decline in the
price of manufactured goods relative to services, which in turn helps to
explain the difference between the behavior of nominal and real manufacturing output. Increased labor productivity in a sector means that fewer hours
are required to make a given amount of output. This reduces the cost of
production and, typically, the relative price of that output. In the same way,
relative prices tend to increase in sectors that have experienced less productivity growth, such as services. For example, the falling prices of computers
and other electronics have contrasted sharply with the rising costs of services.
This example is confirmed by the aggregate data: the average price of
consumption goods relative to services fell more than 50 percent between
1950 and 2000. In contrast to the nearly ninefold increase in the prices for

60 | Economic Report of the President

services, prices for durable goods (goods such as cars and refrigerators that are
expected to last, on average, three years or more) rose by a factor of only
21⁄2 and prices for nondurable goods rose by a factor of about 5 from 1950 to
2000 (Chart 2-8). Expressed another way, to equal the buying power of
$100 worth of durable goods in 1950, a consumer would have spent $250 in
2000, while for $100 worth of services in 1950, a consumer would have
spent $890 in 2000.
The slower growth of manufactured goods prices has increased the
purchasing power of incomes relative to what it otherwise would have been,
but the portion of this increase that Americans have allocated to manufactured goods has not been large enough to maintain manufacturing’s share of
nominal output. The boost to real income from the relative price decline of
manufactured goods has supported demand not only for these goods but
also for services such as health care and financial advice. That is, Americans
have used the resources made available from the relatively slow growth in
manufacturing prices to buy many things, not just manufactured goods.
Increased demand for services, combined with rising relative prices for services, is reflected in the fact that health services and business services each

Chapter 2

| 61

have increased their share of total nominal output about 4 percentage points
since 1950. The finance, insurance, and real estate industry has increased its
share a dramatic 91⁄2 percentage points. The opposite trend has held for
manufacturing, in which relative price declines have not been fully offset by
increases in demand. This explains why the share of manufacturing in total
nominal output has roughly halved since 1950. (All calculations of industry
share of nominal GDP are based on the pre-benchmark data available when
this Report went to press.)
In other words, U.S. demand for manufacturing products has been relatively price inelastic. That is, demand has not been very responsive to price
declines. For example, a family that purchased a car may have reacted to
lower relative car prices (and the increased real income they create) by paying
for college or hiring a home health care aide, rather than by putting those
gains toward the purchase of another car. As a numerical example of inelastic
demand, suppose that people buy 10 compact discs at $20 each (for a total
expenditure of $200). Now suppose the price falls from $20 to $10. If people
buy twice as many compact discs at $10, the value of overall sales will still be
$200 (20 compact discs at $10 each). But if people increase their purchases
to 15 compact discs, the value of overall sales will be only $150, a decline of
25 percent. This is similar to what has happened in manufacturing.
62 | Economic Report of the President

Productivity gains have tempered price increases, and demand has not
responded strongly enough to keep nominal revenues constant as a share of
nominal GDP.
A second factor that has led to a decline in manufacturing’s share of GDP
is that Americans are purchasing more goods from abroad. Goods purchases
as a share of total domestic purchases have been declining for about 30 years.
The share of domestically produced goods has fallen somewhat faster, particularly in the 1970s and 1990s. Domestically produced goods were
91 percent of overall domestic goods purchases in 1970; by 2000, they had
fallen to 68 percent. In other words, imports have made up an increased
share of goods bought in the United States (Chart 2-9).
Growth in exports of manufactured goods from the United States over the
past several decades has offset only some of the growth in imports (Chart 2-10).
As a result, net imports of nonagricultural goods (imports minus exports)
have risen materially, reaching about 30 percent of manufacturing production in 2000 (based on the pre-benchmark data available when this Report
went to press) (Chart 2-11). In relation to the overall economy, net nonagricultural goods imports have also risen, but remained below 5 percent of
GDP in 2000. China has been a growing source of manufacturing imports,
although this growth has not been a major factor in the increase of the U.S.
trade deficit (Box 2-1).

Chapter 2

64 | Economic Report of the President

Box 2-1: China and the U.S. Manufacturing Sector
The recent decline in employment in U.S. manufacturing has
coincided with a sizable increase in the overall U.S. trade deficit and a
sharp increase in the U.S. bilateral trade deficit with China. In part
because of the high visibility of Chinese imports, which are primarily
everyday consumer goods, these events have raised concerns
that imports of Chinese goods come at the expense of American
manufacturing workers.

China’s Trade with the World
While China’s exports and imports grew quickly starting in the early
1990s, China’s trade with the rest of the world has been modest until
very recently (Chart 2-12). The growth in China’s trade has been well
balanced in that increased exports to the world have been matched by
rising imports from the world. According to data from China’s official
statistical agency, China has had a trade deficit with the world
excluding the United States for several years. China recently ran trade
deficits with a number of other countries, including industrial
countries such as Germany and Japan.
China’s Trade with the United States
China has a significant trade surplus with the United States, its
most important export market and the destination of one-quarter of all
Chinese goods exports. The U.S. trade deficit with China—about
$124 billion through November 2003 at an annual rate—is the single
largest bilateral goods and services trade deficit for the United States.
The next-largest bilateral deficit is with Japan, at $66 billion through
November 2003 at an annual rate.
The U.S. trade deficit excluding China has also risen dramatically
since the mid-1990s and is about 31⁄2 times larger than the bilateral
deficit with China (Chart 2-13). China’s share of the overall U.S. trade
deficit in goods has actually fallen since 1997—exactly the period over
which trade with China grew rapidly.
Greater trade with China does not appear to have contributed to an
increased overall U.S. trade imbalance, as the higher share of U.S.
imports from China has been more than offset by a declining share of
imports from other Asian countries. The share of U.S. imports from
the Pacific Rim as a whole has fallen since the mid-1990s (Chart 2-14).
Restrictions on imports from China would be expected to increase
imports from other low-cost foreign producers, rather than to increase
production and employment for American manufacturers. That is, any
job gains from reduced Chinese imports are more likely to occur in
other developing countries rather than the United States.

Chapter 2

| 65

Box 2-1 — continued
U.S. exports to China have grown strongly in the last several years,
with exports to China up more than 60 percent since 2000. As of the
third quarter of 2003, China was the sixth-largest U.S. export market.
Exports to China have grown even while exports to the rest of the
world have stagnated (Chart 2-15).

The Impact of Trade with China on U.S. Manufacturing Employment
Imports from China affect the prospects for domestic firms with
which they compete, and this impact often extends to workers and
communities associated with these firms. This is especially the case
for firms that make items that are relatively intensive in the use of
less-skilled labor, as these are goods in which China has a comparative advantage in production. This may raise the question of whether
imports from China are a primary factor in the displacement of
American manufacturing workers.
A closer look at the data indicates this is not the case. The low level
of U.S. imports from China before the mid-1990s suggests that
declines in employment prior to that period were not due to U.S. trade
with China. The data on more-recent job losses in manufacturing indicate that China is not a primary factor in these declines, either. With
the exception of apparel, the largest job losses have occurred in
export-intensive industries for the United States, and job losses in
U.S. manufacturing have been mainly in industries in which imports
from China are small. For example, the computer and electronic
equipment industry accounts for 15 percent of all manufacturing job
losses since January 2000, but imports from China were only 8
percent of U.S. output in 2002. Other export-intensive industries that
have suffered large job losses include fabricated metal products
(9 percent of manufacturing job losses and 2 percent of U.S. output),
machinery (10 percent and 2 percent), and transportation equipment
(12 percent and 0.4 percent).

Manufacturing Employment over the Long Term
Employment in manufacturing as a share of total employment peaked in
the early 1940s at about one-third of all farm and nonfarm workers. By 2000,
it had declined to just below 13 percent (17 million out of 135 million
employees). Employment in service-providing sectors (including transportation, wholesale and retail trade, finance, insurance, and real estate, and
services) increased from 35 percent of payroll employment in the early 1940s
to 65 percent (86 million workers) of all employees in 2000 (Chart 2-16).
The two main reasons for this shift from the manufacturing sector to
service-providing sectors in the labor market are related to the explanations
for the declining nominal share of manufacturing output. First, increased
demand for services and relatively slow productivity growth in serviceproviding sectors have led to rising demand for workers in these sectors. In
manufacturing, inelastic demand for manufactured goods and faster productivity growth have lowered the relative demand for manufacturing workers.
Second, manufacturing employment likely has fallen in response to the
transfer of manufacturing jobs abroad. The jobs affected have generally been
those involved in the production of goods requiring relatively low skills.

Chapter 2

| 69

Indeed, this is part of the explanation for the rapid growth in manufacturing
productivity over the last 50 years (Chart 2-16). The relatively highly-skilled
American manufacturing workforce has been increasingly focused on
higher-productivity activities. This shift can be seen by looking at compensation for the industries in which employment decreased or increased the
most from 1950 to 2000 (Table 2-1). With a few exceptions, employment
fell dramatically in industries with relatively low-skilled jobs and rose
dramatically in industries with relatively highly-skilled jobs.
This specialization is a natural outcome of the opening of economies all
over the world to trade. As a result of such specialization, world efficiency
increases and world output goes up as countries focus on the activities in
which they are relatively more productive. All countries that participate in
trade benefit from this increased output.
The effect of long-term productivity improvements on the shift to serviceproviding jobs is far more important than increased manufacturing imports.
Two simple hypothetical exercises can help to illustrate this. In the first exercise, imagine that manufacturing productivity was fixed at its value in 1970.
To match the actual amount of manufacturing output in 2000, one-third of
total U.S. nonfarm employment would have been required by manufacturing, compared with the 13 percent required at 2000 productivity levels.
That is, without the increase in manufacturing productivity, manufacturing’s share of nonfarm employment would have increased 8 percentage

points rather than decreased 12 percentage points from 1970 to 2000. As a
second exercise, imagine that trade in manufactured goods was balanced in
2000, so that net exports were zero, but assume that the share of manufacturing employment in 1970 and productivity growth from 1970 to 2000
were their actual values. This would raise the amount of manufactured
goods produced in the United States. Manufacturing employment as a share
of total nonfarm employment, however, would have been only 1 percentage
point higher—14 percent, compared with the actual figure of 13 percent—
if there had been balanced trade in manufactured goods in 2000.

The Effects of Domestic Outsourcing and Temporary
Workers on Measurement of Manufacturing
Employment
The decline in manufacturing employment in the official statistics may
somewhat overstate the number of actual manufacturing production jobs
that have been lost. Changing business practices in the manufacturing
sector have led to both the outsourcing of nonproduction work that used to
be done “in house” and the increased use of temporary workers.
Manufacturing firms that once employed lawyers or accountants in their
legal or finance departments might now hire outside consultants to perform
these services. Counting this outsourcing as a decline in manufacturing jobs
is somewhat misleading, because these workers provide services whether
they are working for a manufacturing firm or an outside firm.
Similarly, manufacturing firms are increasingly using temporary workers,
especially during periods of uncertain demand. Such workers, previously
counted as manufacturing employees, are now counted as service-sector
employees in the payroll employment data, although many of them still
produce manufactured goods. The way in which employment statistics
capture the increased use of outsourcing and temporary workers thus overstates the shift from manufacturing to service-providing jobs.
Much of the outsourced work is taken on by industries that make up the
employment category “Professional and Business Services,” which includes
the temporary-help services industry. The professional and business services
category covers a rapidly growing sector of the labor market, so it is likely
that the understatement of manufacturing employment has increased over
time. Professional and business services grew from just under 3 million
employees in 1950 to over 16 million employees in 2000 (Chart 2-17).
Employment in subgroups of this category increased substantially in the
1990s (Chart 2-18).

Chapter 2

| 71

72 | Economic Report of the President

Results from academic studies can be used to estimate the understatement
of employment in the manufacturing sector, bearing in mind that outsourced
jobs are not necessarily comparable to permanent ones (for example, a
temporary worker may receive fewer benefits than a permanent employee).
One widely-cited study estimates that about one-third of all temporary-help
services employees work in the manufacturing sector. If the official manufacturing employment statistics are adjusted by this amount, the decline in the
level of manufacturing employment in the 1990s is eliminated.
In terms of shares of overall nonfarm employment, adjusted manufacturing
shows a decline of 2.8 percentage points over the 1990s, compared with a drop
of 3.1 percentage points in the reported data. If outsourcing were also
included, the decline in the actual share of employment in the manufacturing
sector would probably be even smaller. In other words, at least one-tenth (and
perhaps as much as one-fourth) of the decline in manufacturing’s share of
employment over the 1990s does not reflect a loss of manufactured goodsproducing jobs. Rather, it reflects how measurement conventions used to
calculate employment statistics account for manufacturers’ increased use of
outsourced workers for tasks previously performed internally. Another example
of how measurement conventions can affect, and confuse, the evaluation of the
manufacturing sector is in the definition of manufacturing (Box 2-2).

Box 2-2: What Is Manufacturing?
The value of the output of the U.S. manufacturing sector as defined
in official U.S. statistics is larger than the economies of all but a
handful of other countries. The definition of a manufactured product,
however, is not straightforward. When a fast-food restaurant sells a
hamburger, for example, is it providing a “service” or is it combining
inputs to “manufacture” a product?
The official definition of manufacturing comes from the Census
Bureau’s North American Industry Classification System, or NAICS.
NAICS classifies all business establishments in the United States into
categories based on how their output is produced. One such category
is “manufacturing. NAICS classifies an establishment as in the manu”
facturing sector if it is “engaged in the mechanical, physical, or
chemical transformation of materials, substances, or components into
new products.
”
This definition is somewhat unspecific, as the Census Bureau has
recognized: “The boundaries of manufacturing and other sectors… can
be somewhat blurry. Some (perhaps surprising) examples of manufac”
turers listed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics are: bakeries, candy stores,

Chapter 2

| 73

Box 2-2 — continued
custom tailors, milk bottling and pasteurizing, fresh fish packaging
(oyster shucking, fish filleting), and tire retreading. Sometimes, seemingly subtle differences can determine whether an industry is classified
as manufacturing. For example, mixing water and concentrate to
produce soft drinks is classified as manufacturing. However, if that
activity is performed at a snack bar, it is considered a service.
The distinction between non-manufacturing and manufacturing
industries may seem somewhat arbitrary but it can play an important
role in developing policy and assessing its effects. Suppose it was
decided to offer tax relief to manufacturing firms. Because the manufacturing category is not well defined, firms would have an incentive
to characterize themselves as in manufacturing. Administering the tax
relief could be difficult, and the tax relief may not extend to the firms
for which it was enacted.
For policy makers, the blurriness of the definition of manufacturing
means that policy aimed at manufacturing may inadvertently distort
production and have unintended and harmful results. Whenever
possible, policy making should not be based upon this type of
arbitrary statistical delineation.

Effects of the Shift to Services on Workers’
Compensation
Many workers affected by the structural developments in manufacturing
have experienced difficult transitions. Studies indicate that displaced
workers have a significant chance of being unemployed or employed in a
part-time job for some time following their job loss. Many of those who are
able to find new jobs suffer earnings declines compared to previous earnings.
Furthermore, workers also experience losses in earnings growth relative to
what they would have had if they had remained continuously employed.
Because of these effects, an often-voiced concern is that the shift toward
employment in services has meant that more Americans are working in
low-paying jobs.
While the shift from the manufacturing sector to service-providing sectors
has been painful for many displaced from the manufacturing sector, the
average effect on compensation—and in particular on new entrants into the
74 | Economic Report of the President

labor force who have chosen to work in services rather than manufacturing—
has been less worrisome. Some service-providing industries pay less than
some manufacturing industries, but much of the employment growth in
service-providing sectors has occurred in industries with higher than average
compensation. The third column of Panel A in Table 2-2 shows the total
compensation per full-time equivalent employee in five service-providing
industries relative to the average across industries: for example, compensation
in wholesale trade in 2000 was 27 percent higher than the average (which
equals 100 percent). The second column gives the change in employment
from 1950 to 2000 for each industry: wholesale trade employment increased
more than 4 million over this period. As Panel A reveals, four of the five
service-providing industries with the largest employment increases paid
compensation roughly at or above the average. Together, these five serviceproviding industries can explain nearly two-thirds of overall private
employment growth from 1950 to 2000. Panel B of Table 2-2 shows that
three of the five manufacturing industries with the highest job-loss rates paid
less than the average private-sector job in 2000. For example, apparel employment fell nearly 600,000 from 1950 to 2000, and compensation of workers
in the apparel industry in 2000 was only 67 percent of the average. As a result
of the large increases in employment in some of these high-paying serviceproviding industries, the gap between compensation in service-providing
sectors and manufacturing has been closing over the last couple of decades.

The Transition in Context
Individuals and communities tied to declining industries experience
dislocation and distress. While many workers have made the transition from
manufacturing to the service sector, the transition can be difficult. To ease
it, the President has supported policies for worker retraining accounts and
has extended unemployment insurance benefits when needed. The appropriate policy responses to this transition will be discussed in more detail later
in this chapter. Before that, however, it is useful to place the evolution of the
U.S. manufacturing sector in a broader context.
First, the shift to a relatively more service-oriented economy has involved
substantial benefits for American consumers and producers. Real incomes
have risen, allowing consumers to purchase more goods and services such as
food, health care, transportation, and education, while measures of the
quality of life and life expectancy have also increased. In addition, the
growth of the service-providing sector has generated new opportunities for
employment in industries such as information technology services, financial
services, and entertainment.
Second, the shift of employment away from lower-productivity manufacturing toward higher-productivity manufacturing and service-providing
sectors reflects economic growth and development, just as the shift away
from agriculture toward manufacturing did in the last century (Box 2-3).
The relative shift from manufacturing toward service-providing sectors has
been shared by other advanced economies over the last few decades (Chart
2-19). Manufacturing employment declined from the mid-1990s to 2002 in
a number of countries whose economies are rapidly developing, including
China, Brazil, and South Korea. In fact, China, Brazil, South Korea, and
Japan had steeper percentage declines in manufacturing employment over
that period than the United States.

Box 2-3: The Evolution of the U.S. Agricultural Sector
The evolution of U.S. manufacturing from 1970 to 2000 mirrors, in
important respects, that of U.S. agriculture from 1940 to 1970. Total
real farm output increased more than 60 percent from 1940 to 1970.
Over the same period, employment in farming declined nearly 6
million, or almost two-thirds of the level in 1940 (Chart 2-20). This
translated into a decline in agriculture’s share of total employment of
15 percentage points, from 19.4 percent in 1940 to 4.4 percent in 1970.
While the histories of agriculture and manufacturing in the United
States differ in some ways, such as the prominent role of subsidies in
the agricultural sector, their similarities help put the long-term story
of the manufacturing sector in context.
In both sectors, a 30-year period of rapid productivity growth
substantially reduced the share of the American workforce needed to
meet demand for food and manufactured goods. Labor productivity in
agriculture nearly quadrupled from 1940 to 1970 (Chart 2-21), a period
that has been called the “second American agricultural revolution.
”

Chapter 2

| 77

Box 2-3 — continued
This productivity boom has been attributed to the invention of
new technologies, such as hybrid crop varieties, as well as the widespread application of existing technologies, such as machinery and
conservation practices.
Agricultural productivity growth led to low growth in the price of
food, bringing substantial benefits to American consumers and the
U.S. economy as a whole and significantly improving U.S. competitiveness in world markets. Despite the mid-century expansion in the
demand for agriculture’s output, prices remained essentially flat. After
the run-up in demand and prices during World War II and its immediate aftermath, agricultural prices increased only 4 percent from 1950
to 1970. The average price of all commodities, in comparison,
increased 35 percent from 1950 to 1970 (Chart 2-22). The lack of food
price inflation is mimicked by the low inflation in manufacturing in the
last few decades, with a sizable benefit for American consumers in
both cases.
The evolution of the agricultural sector has been good for the
economy on the whole, but it meant dislocation for millions of agricultural workers—a process that continues today. Displaced farm
workers faced uncertainty regarding their next job and the applicability of their skills in different sectors, just as manufacturing workers
do today. The 1940s and 1950s saw the rapid growth of new industries
that hired workers no longer needed on farms. Manufacturing itself
likely absorbed a substantial percentage of former agricultural
workers: nearly 8 million new manufacturing jobs were created
between 1940 and 1970, 2 million more than the total decline in agricultural employment.
In the 1970s and 1980s, service-providing sectors likely absorbed
workers not needed in manufacturing. This continued in the 1990s, as
high-tech and financial services accounted for new employment
growth. Looking forward, it is difficult to predict which industries will
grow and require more workers. The past experience of the adjustment in agriculture suggests that market forces will continue to
reshape the American workforce.

The Role of Policy
Markets operating free from government intervention will, in most cases,
best allocate the Nation’s resources across sectors. It is generally a mistake to
target government assistance to a particular sector at the expense of other
sectors, and manufacturing is no exception. That said, government policy
can play a positive role. Policies targeted toward general education and
training, such as the President’s landmark education reforms and proposed
funding to help displaced workers train for new opportunities, will help
people adapt to ongoing structural changes. The President’s Jobs for the 21st
Century plan will support students and workers by improving high school
education and strengthening post-secondary education and job training.
The short-run performance of the manufacturing sector is closely tied to
fluctuations in overall economic activity. Policies that increase aggregate
output and economic growth will help to improve the near-term outlook for
the manufacturing sector. This Administration put forward a six-point plan
for the U.S. economy in September 2003. The plan would help the manufacturing sector along with the overall economy, and it includes the
following components:

80 | Economic Report of the President

Making Tax Relief Permanent
The Administration has undertaken several important fiscal measures to
strengthen growth, including the 2001 tax relief program, the March 2002
stimulus package, and the May 2003 Jobs and Growth Act. These policies
have already contributed to the current recovery in manufacturing. The
President has proposed making provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts
permanent. These include measures that lower the cost of capital and
thereby encourage business investment. Capital investment makes up a relatively large share of manufacturers’ costs, so a lower cost of capital provides
a particularly important benefit to manufacturers. Moreover, manufacturers
produce capital goods, so increased investment demand particularly benefits
manufacturing firms.

Making Health Care Costs More Affordable and Predictable
The President’s proposals aim to reduce frivolous litigation, help individuals
save for future health expenses, and allow small businesses to pool together to
purchase health coverage. Health care costs as a share of total compensation
are one-third higher in manufacturing than in service-providing industries.
The President’s proposals will help manufacturers reduce the burden of
increasing health care costs.

Reducing the Burden of Lawsuits on the Economy
The President seeks to address the burden that lawsuits impose on
American businesses. For example, estimates suggest that roughly 60 companies entangled in asbestos litigation have gone bankrupt primarily because
of asbestos liabilities, displacing between 52,000 and 60,000 workers.

Ensuring an Affordable, Reliable Energy Supply
Initiatives include modernizing the electricity grid and streamlining the
process of acquiring permits for natural gas exploration. This is vital for
manufacturing, which makes up about 15 percent of nominal GDP but
accounts for around one-quarter of energy use in the United States.

Streamlining Regulations to Ensure that they are Reasonable and
Affordable
Research has shown that manufacturing bore about 30 percent of the
costs of regulation in the United States in 2000—nearly double its share of
nominal output.

Opening International Markets to American Goods and Services
This has become particularly important for the manufacturing sector.
While exports accounted for about one-sixth of American manufacturing
production in 1970, they made up nearly half by 2002.
Chapter 2

| 81

Conclusion
The manufacturing sector in the United States has undergone significant
change in the last half-century. Productivity and real output in manufacturing have risen dramatically, and faster than in the economy as a whole.
Productivity improvements have boosted real income in the United States.
However, because Americans have spent much of their real income gains on
services rather than manufactured goods, manufacturing’s share of employment has declined. In the recent recession, manufacturing output and
employment were hit particularly hard. The President’s policies, aimed at
stimulating the overall economy, easing restrictions that impede manufacturing growth, and ensuring that workers have the skills they need to be
competitive, address the short-term difficulties of the sector and ensure its
long-term health.

The Year in Review and the Years Ahead

T

he U.S. economy made notable progress in 2003. The recovery was still
tenuous coming into the year, as continued fallout from powerful
contractionary forces—the capital overhang, corporate scandals, and uncertainty about future economic and geopolitical conditions discussed in
Chapter 1, Lessons from the Recent Business Cycle—still weighed against the
stimulus from expansionary monetary policy and the Administration’s 2001
tax cut and 2002 fiscal package. However, the contractionary forces dissipated
over the course of 2003, and the expansionary forces were augmented by the
Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (JGTRRA) that was signed
into law at the end of May. The economy now appears to have moved into a
full-fledged recovery.
This chapter reviews the economic developments of 2003 and discusses the
Administration’s forecast for the years ahead. The key points in this chapter are:
• Real GDP growth picked up appreciably in 2003. Growth in consumer
spending, residential investment, and, particularly, business equipment
and software investment appear to have increased noticeably in the
second half of the year.
• The labor market began to rebound in the final five months of 2003.
• Core consumer inflation declined to its lowest level in decades.
• The Administration’s forecast calls for the economic recovery to strengthen
further this year, with real GDP growth running well above its historical
average and the unemployment rate falling. Looking further ahead, the
economy is expected to continue on a path of strong, sustainable growth.

Developments in 2003 and
the Near-Term Outlook
After rising 2.8 percent during the four quarters of 2002, real GDP
expanded at an average annual rate of 4.4 percent during the first three quarters of 2003. The economy appears to have gained momentum as the year
went on, with annualized real GDP growth averaging close to 21⁄2 percent
during the first half of the year and more than 8 percent in the third quarter.
The available data suggest solid further growth in the fourth quarter, though
not as spectacular as in the third quarter. (The Report went to print before
GDP data for the fourth quarter were available.)
83

The Administration expects real GDP to grow at an annual rate of
4.0 percent during the four quarters of 2004, a figure that is close to the
latest Blue Chip consensus economic forecast (as of January 10, 2004). The
unemployment rate, which peaked at 6.3 percent in June 2003, is projected
to fall to 5.5 percent by the fourth quarter of 2004.
The pace of real GDP growth during the first three quarters of 2003 was
supported by robust gains in consumption, residential investment, and
defense spending. Inventory investment, in contrast, declined over the first
three quarters of last year. In 2004, the composition of GDP growth is
expected to shift away from government spending and toward business fixed
investment and net exports. Evidence of emerging momentum in investment accumulated over the course of 2003: businesses began to hire, build
inventories, and increase shipments of nondefense capital goods. In addition, expected faster growth among our trading partners and the recent
decline in the exchange value of the dollar make U.S. exporters well
positioned for expansion.
Much of the growth of private demand during 2003 was attributable to
the effects of expansionary fiscal and monetary policy designed to counteract
the lingering effects of the stock market decline, the capital overhang,
worries about geopolitical developments, and concern about accounting
scandals. Much stimulus remains in the pipeline in the form of refunds on
2003 tax liabilities this spring and the ongoing effects of the current low
interest rates. The fiscal stimulus will not disappear suddenly. The reduction
in the tax withholding schedule included in the 2003 fiscal package
(JGTRRA) only began in July 2003, and households are still adjusting to
these lower tax rates. Moreover, tax refunds in the first half of 2004 are
expected to be higher than usual: the tax cuts were retroactive to January
2003, but last year’s withholding changes generally did not capture tax
savings on income earned in the first half of the year. In addition, because
of the 2002 and 2003 tax cuts, businesses will be able to cut their tax liabilities by expensing 50 percent of their equipment investment (rather than
depreciating the new capital) through the end of 2004. The lower tax rates,
higher tax refunds, and investment expensing included in the Jobs and
Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act are expected to reduce tax collections
by about $146 billion in 2004, up from about $49 billion (or about
$98 billion at an annual rate) in the second half of 2003.

Consumer Spending
Consumer spending increased briskly in 2003. Real personal consumption
expenditures increased at an average annual pace of 3 percent during the first
half of the year, and then surged at an annual rate of 6.9 percent in the third
quarter. Data on retail sales and motor vehicle purchases through December
84 | Economic Report of the President

and services outlays through November are consistent with consumer
spending remaining at a high level in the fourth quarter. As a result, real
consumption growth in the second half of the year likely ran noticeably
above that in the first half.
The pickup in spending growth in the second half of the year corresponded
to an increase in the rate of growth of household income. After rising at an
annual rate of 3.6 percent in the first half, real disposable personal income
(that is, inflation-adjusted household income after taxes) jumped at an
annual rate of 6.3 percent in the third quarter, boosted by tax relief, and
appears to have held steady in the fourth quarter.
Wages and salaries increased moderately in the second half of the year,
bolstered by the emerging recovery in the labor market. Moreover, the
personal tax cuts included in the 2003 fiscal package (JGTRRA) meant that
U.S. households were able to keep substantially more of their earnings. The
reduction in withholding and the advance rebates of the child tax credit
added $37 billion to disposable income (not at an annual rate) in the second
half of the year.
Other factors also likely contributed to the strengthening of consumer
spending over the course of 2003. The robust performance of equity
markets and solid gains in home prices bolstered wealth. Household wealth
(net financial resources plus the value of nonfinancial assets such as cars and
homes) increased $21⁄4 trillion during the first three quarters of 2003, and it
probably rose substantially further in the fourth quarter given the solid
increase in broad indexes of stock prices in the last few months of the year.
Consumer sentiment was depressed early in the year by the prospect of war
with Iraq. Sentiment jumped in April and May following the successful resolution of major combat operations and then was little changed until
November, when it picked up noticeably. By the end of the year, household
sentiment was somewhat higher than it had been at the end of 2002 and
much higher than it was just prior to the war with Iraq.
All told, consumption grew in line with household after-tax income
during 2003. Personal saving as a fraction of disposable personal income
averaged 2.3 percent in 2002 and remained at this level, on average, in the
first three quarters of 2003. Swings in personal saving have contributed to
movements in national saving in recent years (Box 3-1).
Growth of real consumption is expected to be lower than that of real GDP
in coming years. As explained in Box 3-1, the relative flatness of the personal
saving rate over the past couple of years is likely the result of offsetting
forces. On the one hand, capital losses associated with the decline in the
stock market from March 2000 to March 2003 probably tempered
consumption (with some lag) and, in turn, caused the personal saving rate
to increase. On the other hand, personal saving was likely depressed by the

Chapter 3

| 85

Box 3-1: Personal Saving and National Saving
One important influence on the personal saving rate (the saving of
the household sector divided by its after-tax income) over the past
10 years has been changes in households’ wealth, although the past
couple of years appear to have been an exception.
Driven by movements in stock prices, the ratio of household wealth
to personal income climbed dramatically in the second half of the
1990s, peaked in early 2000, and then retreated substantially over the
next two years. Economic theory suggests that increases in wealth
tend to raise household spending, and decreases in wealth tend to
lower household spending. This “wealth effect” often produces a
negative correlation between household wealth and the personal
saving rate because personal saving is defined in the national
accounts as the difference between income excluding capital gains
and spending (Chart 3-1).
Empirical studies suggest that an additional dollar of wealth leads
to a permanent rise in the level of household consumption of about
two to five cents, with the adjustment occurring gradually over a
period of one to three years (the range depends on the exact specification—for example, one study found that including the components
of wealth separately produces lower estimates). Such estimates of the
wealth effect can explain the behavior of personal saving in the
second half of the 1990s fairly well. For example, assuming that a
dollar of wealth leads to an increase in consumption of three cents
and that adjustment lags are typical, one would predict that the rise in
wealth in the late 1990s would have caused the saving rate to decline
by 4 percentage points between the end of 1994 and the end of 2000—
close to the actual decline in the saving rate (ignoring the
quarter-to-quarter volatility in the series).
The wealth effect also suggests that the (net) fall in wealth after
2000 would have caused a rebound in the personal saving rate of
more than 2 percentage points. In fact, however, the personal saving
rate has not risen materially. One potential explanation for the divergence is that households have raised consumption in anticipation that
the labor market recovery will continue and, in turn, bolster income.
Some of the additional consumption may have been funded through
the wave of cash-out home mortgage refinancing enabled by the
combination of low interest rates and technological advances that
have made such transactions easier. Another possibility is that the
availability of low-interest-rate loans on cars and other items has
spurred households to replace cars and other durable goods earlier
than they otherwise would have.

86 | Economic Report of the President

Box 3-1 — continued
Direct saving by households represents only part of the total saving
done in the United States. Corporations also save in the form of
retained earnings—the difference between after-tax profits and dividends. Most of the year-to-year variation in retained earnings stems
from profits because dividend payments tend to have a fairly smooth
upward trend over time. Profits rose in the early and mid-1990s,
boosted by brisk productivity growth. After peaking as a share of GDP
in 1997, profits fell over the next few years, owing to the 1998 global
financial crisis, a catch-up of wages to productivity gains, and the
economic slowdown. Retained earnings as a share of GDP also
trended lower over this period. During the first three quarters of 2003,
both profits and retained earnings picked up.
National saving is the sum of private saving (that is, the saving of
households and corporations) and government saving (equal to the
Federal budget surplus plus the state and local government budget
surpluses). The saving of state and local governments tends to make
a small positive contribution to government saving, but in the past
few years, deteriorating fiscal conditions in states and localities have
pushed their overall saving into slightly negative territory. Saving of
the Federal government has declined sharply since 2000, as the recession and tax cuts have pulled down revenue, and homeland security
and national defense expenditures have increased.
National saving rose (as a fraction of GDP) during the 1990s, but has
fallen sharply since 2000 (Chart 3-2). As a fraction of GDP it now
,
stands at the low end of its range since World War II. Although both
government saving and private saving are above their historic lows,
the fact that they are both fairly low at the same time has led to the
low level of national saving.
National saving is important because it represents the portion of
our country’s current income that is being set aside for investment in
new capital. In particular, national saving plus the net capital inflow
from abroad equals domestic investment. Greater saving and investment today boost future national income. To increase national saving,
the President supports raising Federal saving by restraining Federal
spending. He has also proposed Lifetime Savings Accounts and
Retirement Savings Accounts, which are designed to increase incentives
for households to save.

88 | Economic Report of the President

boost to consumption from low interest rates (both directly through the
availability of low-interest-rate loans on durable goods and indirectly
through the funds made available by cash-out mortgage refinancings). As
interest rates and incomes rise over the course of the next several years, the
transitory forces boosting consumption growth should dissipate, and as a
result, real consumption is expected to grow more slowly than real GDP
over the forecast period.
An increase in corporate contributions for defined-benefit pension plans
is likely to boost the saving rate in the near term from what it might be
otherwise. The Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) has estimated that corporate contributions to defined-benefit plans will increase
sharply above 2003 levels. Indeed, rapid increases have already begun,
according to separate data included in the Employment Cost Index. The
contributions raise personal income, but because these funds are not placed
in the hands of employees until retirement, they seem unlikely to affect
current-year consumption. As a result, they should increase the personal
saving rate.

Residential Investment
The housing sector continued to show remarkable vigor in 2003, with real
residential investment climbing at an average annual rate of more than
10 percent in the first three quarters of the year. Housing starts moved above
the already high 2002 level to 1.8 million units in 2003, the largest number
of starts since 1978. In addition, sales of both new and existing single-family
homes rose to record levels.
Some of the strength in housing demand reflected the same gains in
after-tax income and wealth that bolstered real consumer spending. The
low levels of mortgage interest rates were another important driving force.
The interest rate on new fixed-rate 30-year mortgages slipped from an
average of 61⁄2 percent in 2002 to an average of 53⁄4 percent in 2003. This
level is the lowest in the 32 years for which comparable data are available.
Indeed, according to data from the Michigan Survey Research Center,
consumers’ assessments of home-buying conditions remained very positive
in 2003, largely because of low mortgage interest rates. As a result of the
very favorable conditions in the housing sector, the U.S. home-ownership
rate climbed to 68.2 percent in the third quarter of 2003—equal to its
highest level on record.
During 2004, real residential investment is expected to slip lower as
housing starts edge down to levels determined by long-run demographics.

Chapter 3

| 89

Business Fixed Investment
Real business fixed investment (firms’ outlays on equipment, software, and
structures) turned around in 2003, posting an annualized gain of 6.2 percent
during the first three quarters of the year after declines of 10.2 percent during
the four quarters of 2001 and 2.8 percent during the four quarters of 2002.
The acceleration during the year was noteworthy, with real investment rising
at an annual rate of 12.8 percent in the third quarter and indications of
further growth in the fourth quarter, compared with an average annual pace
of 3.1 percent in the first half of the year. The improvement from 2002 to
2003, as well as the pickup over the course of 2003, largely reflected a
strengthening in real purchases of equipment and software.
Within the equipment and software category, the largest increases
occurred for certain high-tech items. Real outlays for computers increased at
an annual rate of 43 percent in the first three quarters of 2003, and real
spending on communications equipment, which had performed particularly
poorly during the recession, rose almost 15 percent. Shipments data suggest
that spending in these categories remained strong in the fourth quarter.
Meanwhile, real investment in software continued its solid upward trend,
rising 12 percent during the first three quarters of the year. Outlays for
transportation equipment were held down by further large declines in
purchases of aircraft in the first three quarters of the year. Finally, the available data suggest that real spending on equipment outside of the high-tech
and transportation categories posted a solid gain over the course of 2003.
The increased momentum in business purchases of capital goods in 2003
likely reflects the factors mentioned in Chapter 1. First, with capital overhangs probably behind them, firms were poised to take advantage of further
declines in prices of high-tech goods stemming from continued technological advances. Second, striking gains in productivity and falling unit labor
costs bolstered corporate profits. Third, the cost of capital was held down by
a number of factors, including falling prices for high-tech capital goods, but
also by low interest rates, rising stock prices, and the investment incentives
introduced in the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002
(JCWAA) and expanded in the 2003 fiscal package (JGTRRA).
The Administration expects the recovery in real business investment in
equipment to strengthen further this year, reflecting the acceleration in
output, continued low interest rates, and the investment incentives provided
by the 2002 and 2003 tax cuts. Fixed investment in equipment and structures tends to be related to the pace of growth in output (along with the cost
of capital), and so the pickup in real GDP growth from 2.8 percent during
the four quarters of 2002 to 4.4 percent during the first three quarters of
2003 is projected to lead to an increase in investment during 2004.

90 | Economic Report of the President

One reason for the development of a capital overhang was the lowered
business expectations of the future level of output that developed just prior
to the past recession. As these projections fell, the demand for investment
also fell. In contrast to that period, current projections of 2004 output have
been rising since mid-2003 and are expected to lead to increased demand for
capital goods in the initial quarters of the forecast.
Growth in equipment investment in 2004 should be further boosted as
firms pull forward spending in anticipation of the expiration of the period
when businesses are able to expense (rather than depreciate) 50 percent of the
value of their equipment investment. The flip side of some investment being
advanced into 2004 is that investment may grow more slowly in 2005. Even
so, the growth of equipment investment in 2005 is projected to be solid.
Despite the emerging recovery in spending on equipment and software,
business demand for structures remained soft in 2003. High overcapacity
seems to have offset the impetus imparted by low interest rates and higher
cash flow. In the office sector, vacancy rates rose substantially for the third
consecutive year. Vacancy rates moved still higher in the industrial sector
and now stand at extremely elevated levels. The good news is that the
substantial declines in total spending on structures seem to have abated.
Indeed, real investment in nonresidential structures was approximately flat
over the first three quarters of 2003, in contrast with a plunge of more than
25 percent during the preceding two years. Strength in oil and gas drilling
and an increase in construction of general merchandise stores during the
year have offset continued softness in some other sectors.
The forces that shape the outlook for business structures—the growth of
output and the cost of capital—are much the same as for business equipment. However, they operate with a longer lag because of the time it takes
to plan and build these structures. Investment in business structures is
projected to post a small gain during 2004.

Business Inventories
Businesses began 2003 with lean inventories following a massive liquidation
in 2001 and little restocking during 2002. Inventory investment was
substantially negative over the first three quarters of 2003, as increases in
production lagged those in final demand. The reasons for this slow response
of production are unclear. Firms may have been surprised by the strength of
final demand, or they may simply have been waiting for compelling
evidence that a sustainable recovery was under way.
The net decline in inventories during the first three quarters of 2003 left
stocks in their leanest position relative to final sales of goods and structures in
at least 50 years. (This lean position results, at least in part, from efficiencies
generated by just-in-time inventory-management techniques.) Stockbuilding
Chapter 3

| 91

seems to have begun in September, however. Inventory investment appears
likely to have made a positive contribution to GDP growth in the fourth
quarter of 2003, and the contribution is projected to remain noticeably
positive through the first half of 2004. Inventory investment is expected to
plateau thereafter at a level that keeps stocks in line with rising sales
throughout 2004 and 2005.

Government Purchases
Real Federal spending (consumption expenditures and gross investment)
climbed at an annual rate of 8 percent during the first three quarters of
2003. The available data suggest that 2003 as a whole likely saw the largest
increase in more than 30 years. The gain during the first three quarters was
led by an annualized rise of 10 percent in real defense spending largely
related to military operations in Iraq. Real nondefense spending rose at an
average annual pace about 4 percent. This gain was less than half as large as
the gain during the four quarters of 2002, when outlays were stepped up
considerably for homeland security.
The defense supplemental appropriations for FY 2004, signed in
November, allows for some further near-term growth in government
purchases. Defense spending is projected to fall during FY 2005, and as a
result, overall Federal spending is projected to edge down.
Like the Federal government, the governments of states and localities saw
their tax receipts decelerate during the economic slowdown. Budgets have
also deteriorated because of rising health care costs and increased demand for
security-related spending. With many of these governments subject to
balanced-budget rules, they have taken a variety of measures to address their
fiscal imbalances, including drawing on accumulated reserves (so-called
“rainy day funds”), raising taxes, and restraining spending. Real expenditures
of state and local governments were little changed during the first three quarters of 2003, in contrast with an average annual gain of around 3 percent over
the preceding five years. With state and local governments still under pressure, their real expenditures are projected to increase slowly during the
coming year. Eventually, their fiscal situations should be improved by
increases in tax revenue resulting from the strengthening of the economy.

Exports and Imports
The U.S. current account deficit as a share of GDP was little changed, on
net, during the first three quarters of 2003, averaging about 5 percent. The
deficit on trade in goods and services as a share of GDP also moved in a
narrow range during the first three quarters. U.S. net investment income (the
income paid to U.S. investors in foreign endeavors less that paid to foreign
92 | Economic Report of the President

investors in U.S. projects) was roughly flat, as both receipts from abroad and
payments to foreign investors rose somewhat during the first three quarters
of 2003. Real imports of goods and services have likely been restrained in
recent quarters by the decline in the value of the dollar. Real imports rose at
an annual rate of 1 percent during the first three quarters of 2003, a substantially slower pace than during the four quarters of 2002. Real imports of
capital goods (other than autos) rose solidly, as would be expected given the
recovery in U.S. investment. Real oil imports increased at a faster pace (on an
annual basis) than during the four quarters of 2002. Real services imports fell
markedly in the first half of 2003 but turned up in the third quarter.
America’s major trading partners have recovered from the global slowdown
somewhat more slowly than has the United States. For example, an index of
real GDP for our G-7 trading partners increased at an average annual pace of
less than 2 percent during the first three quarters of 2003. As a result, foreign
demand for U.S. exports was lackluster in the first half of 2003. Real exports
picked up sharply around the middle of 2003, increasing at an annual pace
of 10 percent in the third quarter. The increase was led by a gain in real
exports of capital goods. Even so, the level of exports remained well below its
peak in 2000.
Prospects for exports over the next two years look better. Growth among
the non-U.S. OECD countries is projected by the OECD Secretariat to rise
2.6 percent during the four quarters of 2004, up from a pace of 1.6 percent
during 2003. Growth is expected to rise further to 2.8 percent in 2005. The
expected growth in foreign markets should support growth in U.S. exports.
In addition, the effect will likely be augmented by a rise in the U.S. market
share of world exports owing to the effects of the 23 percent decline in the
value of the dollar against major currencies from its peak in early 2002
through the end of 2003. The effect of the recent dollar decline on exports
will likely take a couple of years to be fully felt.
Real imports are projected to increase along with domestic output, but the
growth of real imports is likely to be slowed by the recent decline in the
dollar’s value relative to other currencies. On balance, real imports are
projected to grow at about the same pace as GDP, on average, during the next
two years. Nominal imports will increase faster than real imports because
import prices will rise in reaction to the recent dollar decline. Even so, the
current account deficit, which rose to about 5 percent of GDP in the first
three quarters of 2003, is projected to edge up in 2004 and decline thereafter.
Overall, real net exports are expected to be approximately flat during the
next year and are likely to make a positive contribution to real GDP growth
thereafter. Over the next six years, the returns to foreign owners of U.S.
capital are likely to grow faster than the returns to U.S. owners of foreign
capital, a legacy of a long period of strong foreign investment in the United

Chapter 3

| 93

States during the past decade. As a result, real gross national product (GNP),
which includes these net foreign returns to capital, is expected to grow
slower than real gross domestic product (GDP).

The Labor Market
Nonfarm payroll employment fell an average of 50,000 workers per
month in the first seven months of 2003, before increasing 35,000 in
August, 99,000 in September, and an average of 48,000 per month in the
fourth quarter. The strengthening was experienced in most sectors. Job gains
in professional and business services stepped up appreciably from the
modest upward pace seen earlier in the year. Construction employment
began to expand in the second quarter after two years of modest job losses,
and the quarterly averages of employment in the wholesale trade, transportation, and utilities industries turned up at the end of the year. The
manufacturing sector continued to shed jobs through year-end, though the
pace of decline slowed, and the factory workweek climbed more than 0.5
hour, on balance, in the final five months of 2003.
The unemployment rate increased in the first half of 2003, reaching a
peak of 6.3 percent in June, before falling during the second half of the year.
In the fourth quarter, the unemployment rate averaged 5.9 percent, the
same as it had been a year earlier. Because the labor force is constantly
expanding, employment must be growing moderately just to keep the
unemployment rate steady. For example, if the labor force is growing at the
same rate as the population (about 1 percent per year), employment would
have to rise 110,000 a month just to keep the unemployment rate stable,
and larger job gains would be necessary (and are expected) to induce a
downward trend in the unemployment rate.
Looking ahead, temporary-help services employment—a leading indicator
for the labor market—suggests substantial further employment growth.
Average growth in temporary-help services employment over a six-month
period has a striking positive correlation with growth in overall employment
over the subsequent six months (Chart 3-3). Statistical analysis suggests that
an increase of one job in temporary-help services corresponds to a subsequent
rise of seven jobs in overall employment. Employment in temporary-help
services has expanded 194,000 since last April, suggesting robust growth in
overall employment this year. The unemployment rate is projected to fall to
5.5 percent by the fourth quarter of 2004.

94 | Economic Report of the President

Productivity, Prices, and Wages
The consumer price index (CPI) increased 1.9 percent over the 12 months
ended in December 2003, a little below the 2.4 percent rise experienced
during the same period the previous year. Consumer energy prices fluctuated
markedly over the course of 2003, but ended the year 6.9 percent above their
level at the end of 2002. The core CPI (which excludes food and energy) rose
only 1.1 percent during 2003, considerably below the 1.9 percent increase of
the previous year. This deceleration likely stems from the slack in labor and
product markets last year. In addition, unit labor costs were held down by an
impressive performance for labor productivity, with output per hour in the
nonfarm business sector rising at an annual pace of about 6 percent during
the first three quarters of the year following an increase of roughly 41⁄2 percent
during the four quarters of 2002. This pace of productivity growth is well
above the annual average of just over 2 percent experienced since 1960.
Hourly compensation of workers appears to have picked up a little last
year. During the 12 months of 2003, the employment cost index (ECI) for
private nonfarm businesses moved up 4 percent following a 3.2 percent gain
during the previous year. The wages and salaries component of the index
rose 3.0 percent during 2003, slightly below the 2.7 percent increase
recorded for 2002. The benefits component of the ECI, however, surged
6.4 percent over the 12 months of 2003, much faster than the 4.7 percent
Chapter 3

| 95

pace during 2002. The increase in benefits was especially large in the first
quarter of 2003, led by a jump in contributions to defined-benefit pension
plans as employers began making up for losses in the value of pension fund
assets. Employer-paid health premiums rose 10.5 percent during 2003,
roughly the same pace as in 2002.
Core CPI inflation is expected to continue at a low level in 2004, and
overall inflation is expected to be even lower as energy prices retreat further.
Overall CPI inflation is projected to fall to 1.4 percent during the four quarters of 2004—close to the past year’s pace of core inflation. With the
unemployment rate expected to average 5.6 percent for the year as a whole
(above our estimated 5.1 percent midpoint of the range of rates consistent
with stable inflation) the level of slack—although less than in 2003—is still
projected to hold down inflation during 2004. Also keeping inflation in
check is the recent rapid pace of—and solid near-term prospects for—
productivity growth. Offsetting this effect is the somewhat higher pace of
import-price inflation (resulting from the recent dollar decline) and the
quicker pace of GDP growth. Over the next five years, CPI inflation is
expected to edge up, eventually flattening out at 2.5 percent, a level that is
identical to the consensus forecast.
The path of inflation as measured by the GDP price index is similar, but
a bit lower throughout the projection period. Inflation as measured by the
GDP price index is projected fall to 1.2 percent during the four quarters of
2004, the same as the 1.2 percent pace of the core GDP price index during
the first three quarters of 2003. GDP price inflation is projected to increase
slowly thereafter—roughly parallel to the rise in CPI inflation.
The wedge between the CPI and the GDP measures of inflation has
important implications for the Federal budget and budget projections. A
larger wedge reduces the Federal budget surplus because cost-of-living
adjustments for Social Security and other indexed programs rise with the
CPI, whereas Federal revenue tends to increase with the GDP price index.
For a given level of nominal income, increases in the CPI also cut Federal
revenue because they raise income tax brackets and affect other inflationindexed features of the tax code. Of the two indexes, the CPI tends to
increase faster in part because it measures the price of a fixed market basket.
In contrast, the GDP price index increases less rapidly than the CPI because
it reflects the choices of households and businesses to shift their purchases
away from items with increasing relative prices and toward items with
decreasing relative prices. In addition, the GDP price index includes investment goods, such as computers, whose relative prices have been falling
rapidly. Computers, in particular, receive a much larger weight in the GDP
price index (0.8 percent) than in the CPI (0.2 percent).

96 | Economic Report of the President

During the eight years ended in 2002, the wedge between inflation in
the CPI-U-RS (a version of the CPI designed to be consistent with current
methods) and the rate of change in the GDP price index averaged
0.5 percentage point per year. With the core CPI and the core GDP price
index both increasing at about a 11⁄4 percent pace during the past year,
inertia suggests that the near-term wedge will be only about 0.2 percentage
point in 2004. The wedge is expected to widen eventually to its recent
mean of 0.5 percent by 2009.

Financial Markets
Stock prices skidded early in the year, but rallied in March and have been
on a solid uptrend since then. During the 12 months of 2003, the Wilshire
5000 index—a broad measure of stock prices—rose 29 percent. An increase
of this magnitude has not been seen since 1997. High-tech stocks did even
better; for example, the Nasdaq index, which is heavily weighted toward
high-tech industry, rose 50 percent during 2003. Nearly two-thirds of the
rise in broad measures of stock prices occurred after the President signed the
2003 tax cut (JGTRRA) in late May; the Act reduced marginal tax rates on
dividends and capital gains and thus likely contributed to the robust
performance of stock prices.
Following a large decline in 2001, and a smaller one in 2002, the interest
rate on 91-day Treasury bills fell an additional 29 basis points in 2003 and
ended the year at 0.9 percent. These reductions reflected the Federal
Reserve’s efforts to stimulate the economy, leaving real short-term rates (that
is, nominal rates less expected inflation) slightly negative. Following marketbased expectations of interest rates (derived from rates on Eurodollar
futures), the Administration does not expect real rates this low to persist
once the recovery becomes firmly established, and nominal Treasury bill
rates are projected to increase gradually. Long-term interest rates fell sharply
last spring and then rebounded in the summer. For the year as a whole, longterm Treasury rates were about unchanged, but corporate interest rates
dropped a bit as the spread over Treasury rates narrowed. The
Administration projects that the yield on 10-year Treasury notes, which
averaged 4.3 percent in December 2003, will edge up gradually next year,
consistent with the path of short-term Treasury rates.

The Long-Term Outlook
The economy could well grow faster than in the projection presented
here, as the long-run benefits from the full reductions in marginal tax rates
are felt. These should lead to higher labor force participation than would
Chapter 3

| 97

occur otherwise, more entrepreneurial activity, and greater work effort by
highly productive individuals. The Administration, however, chooses to
adopt conservative economic assumptions that are close to the consensus of
professional forecasters. As such, the assumptions provide a prudent and
cautious basis for the budget projections.

Growth in Real GDP and Productivity over the
Long Term
The economy continues to display supply-side characteristics favorable to
long-term growth. Productivity growth has been remarkable, and inflation
remains low and stable. As a result of stimulative fiscal and monetary policies,
real GDP is expected to grow faster than its 3.1 percent potential rate during
the next four years. The Administration forecasts that real GDP growth will
average 3.7 percent at an annual rate during the four years from 2003 to
2007—in line with the consensus projection. Because this pace is somewhat
above the assumed rate of increase in productive capacity, the unemployment
rate is projected to decline over this period. In 2008 and 2009, real GDP
growth is projected to continue at its long-run potential rate of 3.1 percent,
and the unemployment rate is projected to be flat at 5.1 percent (Table 3-1).
The growth rate of the economy over the long run is determined by its
supply-side components, which include population, labor force participation,
productivity, and the workweek. The Administration’s forecast for the contribution of different supply-side factors to real GDP growth is shown in Table 3-2.

of Labor (Bureau of Labor Statistics).

The Administration expects nonfarm labor productivity to grow at a
2.1 percent average annual pace over the forecast period, virtually the same as
that recorded during the 43 years since the business-cycle peak in 1960. The
projection is notably more conservative than the roughly 41⁄2 percent average
annual rate of productivity growth since the output peak in the fourth quarter
of 2000. After such an extraordinary surge, a period of slower productivity
growth is likely as firms shed their hesitancy to hire. In addition, the slower
pace of productivity assumed in the forecast reflects the Administration’s view
that in the absence of a good explanation for the recent acceleration, it is wiser
to base the productivity forecast on longer-term averages.
In addition to productivity, growth of the labor force (also shown in Table
3-2) is projected to contribute 1.0 percentage point per year to growth of
potential output on average through 2009. Labor force growth results from
growth in the working-age population and changes in the labor force participation rate. The Bureau of the Census projects that the working-age
population will grow at an average annual rate of 1.1 percent through
2009—roughly the same pace as during the years between 1990 and 2003.
The last year in which the labor force participation rate increased was 1997,
Chapter 3

| 99

so the long-term trend of rising participation appears to have come to an
end. Since then, the participation rate has fallen at an average 0.2 percent
annual pace—although some of the decline in 2001 and 2002 probably
resulted from the recession-induced decline in job prospects. In 2003, the
baby-boom cohort was 39 to 57 years old, and over the next several years the
boomers will be moving into older age brackets with lower participation
rates. As a result, the labor force participation rate is projected to edge down
an average of 0.1 percent per year through 2009. The decline may be greater,
however, after 2008, which is the year that the first baby boomers (those
born in 1946) reach the early-retirement age of 62.
In sum, potential real GDP is projected to grow at a 3.1 percent annual
pace, slightly above the average actual pace since 1973 of 3.0 percent. Actual
real GDP growth during the six-year forecast period is projected to be
slightly higher, at 3.4 percent, because the civilian employment rate (line 4
of Table 3-2) makes a small (0.2 percentage point) and transitory contribution to growth through 2007 as the unemployment rate falls. This
contribution then ends as the unemployment rate stabilizes at 5.1 percent.

Interest Rates over the Long Term
The gradual increase in the interest rate on 91-day Treasury bills is projected
to continue through 2009. The rate is expected to reach 4.4 percent by 2009,
at which date the real interest rate on 91-day Treasury bills will be close to its
historical average. The projected path of the interest rate on 10-year Treasury
notes is consistent with that on short-term Treasury rates. By 2008, this yield
is projected to be 5.8 percent, 3.3 percentage points above expected CPI inflation—a typical real rate by historical standards. By 2009, the projected term
premium (the difference between the 10-year interest rate and the 91-day rate)
of 1.4 percentage points is in line with its historical average.

The Composition of Income over the Long Term
A primary purpose of the Administration’s economic forecast is to estimate
future government revenue, which requires a projection of the components
of taxable income. The Administration’s income-side projection is based on
the historical stability of the long-run labor and capital shares of gross
domestic income (GDI). During the first three quarters of 2003, the labor
share of GDI was on the low side of its historical average. From this jumpoff point, it is projected to rise to its long-run average and then remain at this
level over the forecast period. (The income share projections are consistent
with data available through December 2, 2003. They exclude any effects of
the later comprehensive revision to the National Income and Product
Accounts.) The labor share consists of wages and salaries, which are taxable,
employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds (that is,
100 | Economic Report of the President

fringe benefits), which are not taxable, and employer contributions for
government social insurance. The Administration forecasts that the wage and
salary share of compensation will decline while employer contributions for
employee pension and insurance funds grow faster than wages. This pattern
has generally been in evidence since 1960 except for a few years in the late
1990s. During the next five years, the fastest growing components of
employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds are
expected to be employer-paid health insurance and contributions for definedbenefit pension plans.
The capital share (the complement of the labor share) of GDI is expected
to fall before leveling off at its historical average. Within the capital share, a
near-term decline in depreciation (an echo of the decline in short-lived
investment during 2001 and 2002) helps boost corporate economic profits,
which in the third quarter 2003 were noticeably above their post-1973
average of about 8 percent of GDI. The share of corporate economic profits
in GDI is projected to be bolstered in 2004 by the strong recent productivity
growth together with stable gains in hourly compensation, and an expected
decline in depreciation. From 2005 forward, the profit share is expected to
slowly decline back to its historical average of about 8 percent. The projected
pattern of book profits (known in the national income accounts as “profits
before tax”) reflects the 30 percent expensing provisions of the Job Creation
and Worker Assistance Act of 2002 and the 50 percent expensing provisions
of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. These
expensing provisions reduce taxable profits from the third quarter of 2001
through the fourth quarter of 2004. The expiration of the expensing provisions increases book profits thereafter, however, because those investment
goods expensed during the three-year expensing window will have less
remaining value to depreciate thereafter. The share of other taxable income
(the sum of rent, dividends, proprietors’ income, and personal interest
income) is projected to fall, mainly because of the delayed effects of past
declines in long-term interest rates, which reduce personal interest income
during the projection period.

Conclusion
The Administration’s policies have been a key force shaping recent
economic developments and the prospects for economic growth in coming
years. The policies are designed to enhance U.S. economic growth, not just
maintain it. The remaining chapters of this Report illustrate the ways in which
pro-growth economic policies can improve economic performance by striking
a balance between encouragement and regulation of firms, by reducing
barriers to trade, and by reducing tax-based disincentives to economic activity.

Tax Incidence:
Who Bears the Tax Burden?

T

he study of tax incidence is the economic study of which taxpayers bear
the burden of a tax. This question is of considerable importance to policy
makers, who want to know whether the distribution of the tax burden
(between rich and poor, capital and labor, consumers and producers, and so
on) meets their criteria for fairness.
Distributional tables showing the tax burdens borne by different income
groups are an important application of incidence analysis. The Joint
Committee on Taxation (JCT) and the Department of the Treasury prepare
distributional tables for the existing tax system and for some proposed and
adopted tax changes. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) prepares such
tables for the existing tax system. In addition to these official analyses, some
private groups also publish distributional tables.
When used properly, distributional tables can contribute to informed
decision making on the part of citizens and policy makers. Unfortunately,
mainstream economic analysis suggests that these tables do not always accurately describe who bears the long-run burden of certain taxes. This problem
does not arise from bias or lack of economic knowledge on the part of the
economists who prepare these tables. Instead, it reflects resource and data
limitations, uncertainty about some of the economic effects of taxes, and variations in the time frame considered by the analyses. Nevertheless, the
shortcomings of distributional tables can lead to misperceptions of the impact
of tax changes.
This chapter discusses some of the ways in which distributional tables can
be improved. The key points in this chapter are:
• The actual incidence of a tax may have little to do with the legal specification of its incidence. Official distributional tables recognize this fact in
many contexts, but not in all of them.
• In the long run, a large part of the burden of capital taxes is likely to be
shifted to workers through a reduction in wages. Analyses that fail to recognize this shift can be misleading, suggesting that higher income groups bear
an unrealistically large share of the long-run burden of such taxes.
To begin, it is useful to review the basic economic principles of tax incidence
and apply them to different types of taxes.

103

Theory of Tax Incidence
One crucial finding in the study of tax incidence is that the economic incidence
of a tax (the identity of the person who bears the burden of the tax) can be
completely different from its statutory or legal incidence (the identity of the
person upon whom the law officially imposes the tax). In other words, the
person who is legally responsible for paying the tax may not be the one who
actually bears the burden of the tax. As explained below, the incidence of a
tax depends upon the law of supply and demand, not the laws of Congress.
Another crucial principle is that only people can pay taxes. Businesses and
other artificial entities cannot pay taxes. Although the corporate income tax
is legally imposed on firms that are organized as corporations, the actual
burden of the tax can fall only on people—perhaps the firm’s owners, or its
employees, or its customers—but certainly not on a legal artifact such as a
corporation. Similarly, although the estate tax is legally imposed on the estate,
the burden of the tax can fall only on people—perhaps the decedent who left
the estate, perhaps the heirs, perhaps other people—but not the estate, which
is merely a legal construct established to sort through the ownership of the
decedent’s assets.
It is simplest to first discuss the incidence of a simple excise tax, a tax levied
on a specific good or service. As explained below, the key insights from this
analysis can be extended to apply to other types of taxes.

Incidence of an Excise Tax
Consider a tax on apples. Suppose that when there is no tax, the price of
apples is $1. Now, suppose that the government imposes a 10-cent excise tax
on apples and that the producers are legally responsible for paying this tax.
Do producers actually bear the economic burden of the tax?
The answer depends on what happens to the price of apples. If the price
remains unchanged, producers bear the economic burden (the economic
incidence of the tax is the same as the legal incidence). Consumers pay $1,
the same as before, and suffer no burden. Producers, after collecting $1 from
the consumers, must pay 10 cents to the government, so they clear only 90
cents. Alternatively, if the price rises by the amount of the tax, from $1 to
$1.10, consumers bear the burden. Although they do not send any money
to the government, they pay 10 cents more per apple than they did without
the tax. The producers bear no economic burden, even though they are
legally responsible for paying the tax. After collecting $1.10 from consumers
and sending 10 cents to the government, they still clear $1, as they did
without the tax. In this case, economists say that the producers shift the
burden of the tax to consumers. To consider another possibility, if the price
of apples rises by 5 cents, to $1.05, consumers and producers share the
104 | Economic Report of the President

burden equally. Consumers bear a 5-cent burden because they pay $1.05 for
each apple, compared to the $1 that they paid without the tax. Producers
bear a 5-cent burden because they clear only 95 cents per apple, compared
to the $1 they cleared without the tax: they collect $1.05 from consumers,
but send 10 cents to the government.
As these examples show, the division of the tax burden between
consumers and producers depends on what happens to the price of apples.
When prices are free to adjust, they are likely to be determined by the law
of supply and demand. If the price of apples was $1 with no tax, then the
number of apples consumers wanted to buy at that price must have equaled
the number of apples that producers wanted to sell at that price.
What happens when the 10-cent excise tax is imposed? It depends on how
responsive consumers and producers are to changes in the prices they pay or
receive. The relevant questions are: How many fewer apples do producers
sell if the amount they clear per apple declines? How many fewer apples do
consumers buy if the amount they pay per apple rises?
For example, suppose that producers are four times more responsive to
price changes than consumers. Then, producers face a price change that is
one-fourth as large as that faced by consumers. The 10-cent tax causes the
price to rise from $1 to $1.08, putting an 8-cent burden on consumers and
a 2-cent burden on producers. At that price, the number of apples
consumers want to buy falls by the same amount as the number that
producers want to sell. Alternatively, if consumers were four times more
responsive than producers, then producers would bear 8 cents of the burden
and consumers would bear only 2 cents.
The group that is less responsive bears more of the burden of the tax. The
group that is more responsive escapes much of the burden because it
responds to the tax, abandoning the taxed activity when threatened with a
tax burden. The price-responsiveness of each group depends upon its flexibility. Do producers have good alternatives (in the form of other industries
in which they can produce)? Do consumers have good alternatives (in the
form of other products they can buy)?
The answers vary across products, types of producers (such as workers and
owners of capital), and time frames. If the excise tax applied only to Granny
Smith apples, consumers could switch to other, untaxed, kinds of apples. If
it applied to all apples, consumers would have somewhat less flexibility.
Some workers may have skills specific to the apple industry. Other workers
may be more flexible because their skills are more general; they could avoid
bearing the tax burden by finding a job in another industry. The owners of
capital employed in a taxed industry may bear a significant short-run burden
because the buildings and equipment in the industry may be designed
specifically for its use and the owners may have little ability to move those

Chapter 4

| 105

resources elsewhere. In the long run, though, capital can leave the taxed
industry: as buildings and equipment depreciate in the taxed industry, new
buildings and equipment are constructed in other industries.
A similar logic applies if the product is subsidized rather than taxed. The
group that is more responsive receives the smaller benefit because the subsidy
prompts new members of that group to enter the market and compete away
the benefits of the subsidy. Conversely, the group that is less responsive
receives the greater benefit from the subsidy because little entry occurs.
Because the incidence of an excise tax depends upon the relative flexibility
of consumers and producers, the burden may not always fall where the
Congress intends. When the Congress imposed a “luxury” tax on yachts in
1991, for example, it intended the wealthy purchasers of yachts to bear the
burden. Such purchasers, however, may be quite responsive to price because
there are many alternative goods that they can purchase (expensive cars and
jewelry, for example). If this is so, then a significant part of the burden of a
yacht tax may fall on workers in the industry, who may be less well-off than
owners of yachts. Indeed, after the tax was introduced, production and
employment in the boat industry fell, leading some observers to claim that
workers were bearing much of the burden of the tax. Although the validity
of this claim cannot be conclusively determined (the industry’s decline may
have been caused by the 1990-1991 recession rather than the tax), the
Congress responded to these concerns by repealing the tax in 1993.

Legal Incidence Is Unimportant
As long as prices can freely adjust, the economic incidence of a tax does
not depend on the legal incidence. Suppose that, in the above example, the
government imposes the 10-cent excise tax on apple consumers rather than
apple producers. Consumers then must make the tax payment to the
government, in addition to the price they pay to producers.
Because producers are four times more price-responsive than consumers,
the price received by producers must still fall by 2 cents and the price paid
by consumers must still rise by 8 cents. Despite the legislative change, that
is still the only outcome that keeps the number of apples producers want to
sell equal to the number that consumers want to buy. If the tax is legally
imposed on producers, they shift 8 cents of the burden to consumers. If it is
legally imposed on consumers, they shift 2 cents of the burden to producers.
Given that the price can freely adjust, it should not be surprising that the
final outcome is unchanged. It is irrelevant whether the tax collector stands
next to consumers and takes 10 cents from them when they buy an apple or
stands next to producers and takes 10 cents from them when they sell an
apple. It does not matter whether the consumer puts a dime in a bowl marked
“taxes” or hands the dime to the producer who puts it in the same bowl.

Applied Distributional Analysis of Excise Taxes and
Subsidies
The legal incidence of Federal excise taxes is sometimes placed on
consumers, sometimes on manufacturers, and sometimes on other
producers or importers. In most cases, this legal incidence rightly receives
little attention. In accordance with the economic theory of tax incidence,
the JCT and Treasury economists preparing distributional tables uniformly
ignore the legal incidence of conventional excise taxes. The JCT generally
allocates excise tax burdens to consumers. Treasury follows a similar, but
more elaborate, approach.
These approaches are reasonable, since consumers are likely to bear much of
the long-run burden of most excise taxes. In the long run, most producers are
flexible, or price-responsive, because they can switch to other industries.
Consumers are likely to have less flexibility, except in special cases where there
are good substitutes for the product being taxed.
The theory of incidence also applies to more-subtle excise subsidies, such
as those included within the individual income tax. The income tax law
grants tax reductions for purchasers of various products—for example, an
itemized deduction for medical expenses, a credit for electric cars, and the
Hope and Lifetime Learning credits for the costs of higher education. The
economic benefits of these provisions are likely to be divided between
consumers and producers, with the greater benefit going to the group that
is less price-responsive. The long-run benefits are likely to go largely to
consumers, because they are likely to be less price-responsive than producers.
Official distributional analyses generally allocate these income tax reductions to the consumers.
The basic insight that tax burdens fall more heavily on groups that are less
flexible can be applied to a wide range of taxes. The remainder of this
chapter applies this framework to payroll taxes, taxes on capital, and estate
and gift taxes.

Payroll Taxes
The largest Federal payroll tax, earmarked to finance Social Security and
Medicare Part A, is imposed at a 15.3 percent rate on the first $87,900 of
earnings and at a 2.9 percent rate on earnings above that amount. A much
smaller Federal payroll tax, earmarked to finance unemployment compensation, is imposed at a 0.8 percent rate on the first $7,000 of earnings. The
legal incidence of the Social Security-Medicare tax is divided equally
between employers and employees. The legal incidence of the Federal unemployment compensation tax is placed entirely on employers.
Chapter 4

| 107

With a payroll tax, the product being taxed is labor and its price is the
wage rate. Applying the insights obtained from the analysis of excise taxes,
the relevant question is whether firms’ demand for labor or workers’ supply
of labor is more responsive to changes in the wage rate. In the long run, it is
likely that firms are more responsive, or flexible, particularly in a global
economy in which they can relocate abroad. This conclusion implies that
employees bear most of the payroll tax burden, a result supported by empirical studies. In other words, wages paid to employees are lower by an amount
roughly equal to the employers’ part of the payroll tax. In accord with this
conclusion, official distributional analyses generally assign the full burden of
payroll taxes to employees. The primary controversy in this area concerns
whether the distributional analysis should also include the Social Security
benefits that are financed by the payroll tax (Box 4-1).
Much of the individual income tax is also imposed on labor income.
Based on the above discussion, the burden of the individual income tax on
labor, like that of payroll taxes, should also fall on workers. Official distributional analyses generally allocate the individual income tax on labor
income to workers.
Some taxes on and subsidies to labor income are more subtle. The income
tax laws deny firms their normal business-expense deductions for some
payments of labor income. For example, under certain circumstances, firms
cannot deduct salaries greater than $1,000,000 per year paid to senior executives or some “golden-parachute” payments made to executives in
connection with corporate takeovers. Because of this denial of deductibility,
the firm pays a tax on these labor income payments, in addition to the
regular tax on its owners’ net income. This tax operates as an additional
payroll tax legally imposed on employers, although of a much narrower
scope than the payroll taxes discussed above. On the other hand, the income
tax laws allow firms to claim tax credits for some other payments of labor
income. Examples include the work opportunity tax credit, the welfare-towork credit, the empowerment zone employment credit, and the Indian
employment credit. (The work opportunity and welfare-to-work credits
expired on December 31, 2003, but may be reinstated by future legislation.)
In economic terms, these credits are subsidies to labor.
The fact that these taxes and subsidies are implemented as changes in the
employer’s (rather than the employee’s) income tax does not change their
economic incidence. The fact that they apply only to employees in specific
jobs or in specific locations or to those receiving specific forms of compensation, however, may change their incidence. Because employees can, to some
extent, change their jobs, locations, and forms of compensation, the flexibility of the employee may be greater than was assumed in the discussion of
general taxes on labor income. As a consequence, the division of the burdens
108 | Economic Report of the President

Box 4-1: Social Security and Transfer Payments in
Distributional Tables
In addition to collecting taxes, the government makes transfer
payments to households. The net burden that the fiscal system
imposes on households is better measured by looking at tax payments
minus transfer payments received rather than by looking at tax
payments alone. Official distributional tables, however, usually show
only tax payments. They do not tabulate the distribution of transfer
payments, except sometimes the refundable tax credits that are
administered through the individual income tax, such as the Earned
Income Tax Credit. For example, if a household has $20,000 of wage
income, pays $5,000 in taxes, and receives transfer payments of
$2,000, the distributional table would report that the household bears
a $5,000 tax burden, overlooking the fact that its net burden imposed
by the fiscal system is only $3,000. In some tables, transfer payments
are included in the income measure that is used to classify households
into different income groups—in this example, the household might be
classified as having income of $22,000 rather than $20,000. But, the
transfer payments are not netted against the taxes in measuring the
household’s burden.
This practice induces a potential political bias because policy
makers receive “distributional credit” for helping the poor only if they
do so through the tax system rather than through transfer payments.
The omission of government benefits from distributional tables
may provide a misleading picture of Social Security. Official distributional tables generally show that the Social Security payroll tax
imposes a smaller burden, as a fraction of income, on high income
groups than on lower and middle income groups. However, if the
analysis were expanded to include the Social Security benefits
financed by the payroll tax, it would likely reveal that high income
groups bear a larger net burden, as a fraction of income, than some
other groups. Thus, distributional tables might be more accurate if
these benefits were included in some manner. One possibility would
be to treat the present value of the future benefits accrued by a worker
each year as an offset to his or her payroll tax liability.

or benefits between employees and firms is not clear. Official distributional
analyses generally allocate the burdens and benefits of these provisions in the
same manner as firms’ other income tax payments. (As discussed below, these
analyses differ in their treatment of the corporate income tax.)

Taxes On Capital Income
The Federal tax system imposes taxes on capital income. Capital income
generated by corporations is generally subject to the corporate income tax.
Capital income received by individuals is generally subject to the
individual income tax.
Many observers view capital income taxes as highly progressive because
capital income is highly concentrated. However, economic analysis suggests
that capital income taxes are particularly likely to be shifted, especially in the
long run. Taxes imposed on owners of capital in one sector of the economy
may be shifted to the owners of capital in other sectors. More importantly,
capital income taxes may be partly shifted to workers through a reduction in
wages. The extent of shifting differs across time horizons because savers (who
provide capital and earn capital income) are more flexible in the long run
than in the short run.

Shifting Across Sectors
Even if a tax is imposed on capital income in one sector of the economy,
it is likely that owners of capital in all sectors bear the same economic
burden in the long run. To see why, note that if capital is mobile across
sectors, after-tax rates of return must be equalized across sectors, after adjustment for risk. Suppose that an economy contains two sectors and that, when
there are no taxes, capital earns a 6 percent rate of return in each sector.
Now, suppose that a 50 percent tax is imposed on capital income in one
sector, while no tax applies in the other sector. In the very short run, capital
in the taxed sector earns an after-tax return of only 3 percent, while capital
in the tax-exempt sector earns an after-tax return of 6 percent. At this point,
only the owners of capital in the taxed sector bear the burden.
This state of affairs cannot continue. Owners of capital in the taxed sector
will move their money out of that sector and begin investing in the taxexempt sector. As they do so, two things happen. First, the before-tax rate of
return rises in the taxed sector as capital becomes more scarce. Second, the
before-tax rate of return falls in the tax-exempt sector as capital becomes
more plentiful. This movement continues until investors are indifferent
between the two sectors, which happens when after-tax rates of return are
once again in balance. For example, after a certain amount of capital has
relocated, the before-tax rate of return in the taxed sector may rise from 6 to
8 percent, while the before-tax rate of return in the tax-exempt sector may
fall from 6 to 4 percent. At this point, investors in both sectors earn the same
4 percent after-tax rate of return. Because all investors initially earned
6 percent and now earn 4 percent, they all bear the same burden from the
tax, even though the tax legally applies to only one sector.
110 | Economic Report of the President

For example, the corporate income tax is likely to be shifted across sectors.
This tax applies only to the corporate sector, but the above analysis suggests
that the burden is shared by owners of capital in both the corporate and
noncorporate sectors. Similarly, tax provisions that apply to only a single
industry are likely to ultimately affect owners of capital in all industries.

Shifting to Workers
Shifting across sectors may not be the most important way in which the
burden of capital income taxes is shifted. In the long run, much of the
burden of capital income taxes (whether imposed at the firm or individual
level) is likely to be shifted to workers. The reason is that such taxes reduce
investment, which diminishes the capital stock. With a smaller capital stock,
the before-tax rate of return to capital is higher, offsetting part of the burden
that the owners of capital would otherwise bear. Also, workers are less
productive because they have a smaller capital stock to work with and earn
lower real wages. Part of the tax burden is therefore shifted to workers.
In accordance with the insights obtained by studying the incidence of
excise taxes, owners of capital bear less of the burden if the supply of capital
is more responsive to changes in its after-tax rate of return. This responsiveness, and hence the extent to which capital income taxes are shifted, depends
upon several factors, including the amount of time that has elapsed since the
tax was imposed, the willingness of consumers to substitute between current
and future consumption, and the extent to which capital can escape the tax
by relocating abroad.
The time frame is very important. The shifting of the tax burden to
workers is likely to occur slowly because it takes time for large changes in the
capital stock to occur. In the short run, the tax causes little change in the
capital stock, because most of the capital on hand was already in existence
when the tax was adopted. With little change in the capital stock, very little
of the burden is shifted from owners of capital to workers. Over time,
however, the tax has a greater impact on the capital stock as it discourages
the accumulation of new capital. As a result, more of the tax burden falls on
workers and less falls on owners of capital.
Under certain assumptions, the entire burden of the capital income tax is
shifted to workers in the long run, although owners of capital bear much of
the burden in the short run. A textbook model of economic growth, called
the Ramsey model, provides an illustration of this effect. (The Appendix to
Chapter 5, Dynamic Revenue and Budget Estimation, explains the basic
features of this model.) Using plausible values for the key inputs to the
Ramsey model demonstrates that the economy adjusts only gradually to a
capital tax increase. Initially, 100 percent of the burden of a capital tax
increase is borne by the owners of capital, since they have already invested
Chapter 4

| 111

in the capital currently in place. Five years after the tax increase, about a
quarter of the tax burden has shifted to workers. Ten years after the tax
increase, workers have taken on over 40 percent of the burden. It takes
50 years for the burden to shift nearly completely—by that time, capital
owners bear only 6 percent of the burden and workers bear 94 percent.
If consumers are more willing to substitute between present consumption
and the future consumption made possible by their savings, saving is more
responsive to the after-tax rate of return and more of the capital income tax
is shifted. The responsiveness of saving to the after-tax rate of return also
depends on consumers’ planning horizons. The Ramsey model assumes that
consumers consider the impact of their saving decisions on their descendants. If, instead, consumers plan only for their own lifetimes, saving is less
responsive to changes in its after-tax rate of return and less of the capital
income tax burden is shifted to workers.
International capital flows also play a role. If the tax applies only to capital
located in the United States and capital is mobile across international
boundaries, the tax is more likely to be shifted to workers. The above
example assumes that there are no international capital flows; incorporating
such flows would increase the speed at which the tax is shifted.
Empirical work provides some evidence that capital income taxes are
shifted to some extent: studies find that the before-tax return to capital
income is higher when the tax rate on capital income is higher. However, the
picture is not entirely clear, because other factors may cause tax rates and
before-tax rates of return to move together.
The belief that a large portion of the capital income tax burden is shifted
in the long run is common in the economics profession. In a 1996 survey,
public finance economists were asked to state “the percentage of the current
corporate income tax in the United States that is ultimately borne by
capital.” The average response was 41 percent, and three-quarters of the
respondents gave answers of 65 percent or less. This survey indicates that the
average public finance economist believes that more than half of the tax is
eventually shifted from the owners of capital to workers or other groups.
Because labor income is more evenly distributed across taxpayers than capital
income is, recognizing that part of the burden of capital income taxes is shifted
to workers reveals that high income taxpayers bear a smaller share of the burden
than is often assumed. Chart 4-1 classifies households by their levels of total
income and tabulates the share of national labor income and national capital
income earned by different groups. The chart shows, for example, that the 10
percent of households with the highest total incomes receive 37 percent of labor
income and 62 percent of capital income. If half of capital taxes are shifted to
workers in the long run, the fraction of the burden falling on this high-income
group is reduced from 62 percent to 49 percent; if all capital taxes are shifted to
workers in the long run, the high-income share of the burden falls to 37 percent.
112 | Economic Report of the President

Applied Distributional Analysis and the
Choice of Time Frame
Official distributional analyses differ in their treatment of the corporate
income tax. The JCT previously distributed the burden to owners of corporate capital, but now does not distribute it on the grounds that the incidence
of the corporate income tax is uncertain. The CBO and Treasury now
distribute the corporate tax burden to owners of all capital. None of these
analyses currently recognizes the shifting of the tax to workers. The CBO
previously presented analyses that allocated half of the burden to workers
and Treasury did the same in its January 1992 corporate integration study.
Official analyses generally allocate individual income taxes on capital
income to the persons who bear the legal incidence of the taxes.
The time frame plays a key role in how tax incidence is treated. When the
JCT adopted its former practice of allocating the corporate income tax to
corporate capital, it stated that its analysis was intended to refer to the very
short run, when little shifting of any kind would occur. Similarly, Treasury
has justified allocating the burden to owners of all capital by stating that this
is the most reasonable assumption for incidence over a 10-year horizon.
These analyses serve the useful objective of informing policy makers of how
the current tax burden is divided between current workers and current
owners of capital.
Chapter 4

| 113

Nevertheless, presenting estimates only for short time frames leaves an
incomplete picture. If a tax change is intended to be permanent, it is important to also inform policy makers how its long-run burden will be divided
between future workers and future owners of capital. Answering that question requires additional distributional tables that recognize the significant
shifting to workers that is likely to occur in the long run.

Estate and Gift Taxes
Capital can also be subject to estate and gift taxes when its ownership
changes hands due to an inheritance or gift. The lessons from the analysis of
capital income taxes can therefore be applied to estate and gift taxes.
The estate and gift taxes apply on a cumulative basis to an individual’s
lifetime gifts and to the estate the individual bequeaths at his or her death.
An individual may make up to $11,000 of gifts to any recipient per year,
without counting them against the lifetime total. Bequests to surviving
spouses are exempt, as are gifts and bequests to charitable organizations.
The taxes apply only when lifetime gifts plus the estate exceed an exemption amount, which was $675,000 in 2001. Under the laws in place at the
beginning of 2001, the exemption amount was scheduled to increase to
$1,000,000 starting in 2006. The taxes applied at rates of up to 55 percent.
The tax law adopted in June 2001 provides for further reductions in the
estate and gift taxes for 2002 through 2009. This law increases the exemption amount to $1 million for 2002 and 2003 and gradually increases it to
$3.5 million for 2009. The law reduces the top tax rate from 2002 to 2009,
with top rates of 50 percent in 2002 and 45 percent in 2007 through 2009.
For 2010, the law completely repeals the estate tax, but retains the gift tax
with a top rate of 35 percent. It also increases, in some cases, the capital
gains taxes paid by heirs who sell property that they inherit.
Because the 2001 tax law is scheduled to expire at the end of 2010, the
estate and gift taxes are scheduled to return in 2011, at the levels specified
by the previous laws. The President has proposed permanently extending the
provisions of the 2001 tax law that are in effect in 2010, including the repeal
of the estate tax.
The issue of who benefits from estate tax repeal has been a prominent one in
the debate over repeal. Treasury allocates the burden of estate and gift taxes to
the decedents (the individuals who have died) and donors. The JCT used to do

114 | Economic Report of the President

the same, but has now stopped distributing them due to uncertainty about the
taxes’ incidence. The CBO’s recent distributional analyses have not included
estate and gift taxes. Allocating the estate tax burden to decedents supports the
common view that the tax is highly progressive, since (at the current exemption
amount) the tax applies to only the largest 2 percent of estates.
It is virtually certain, however, that little of the economic burden of the
estate tax is borne by the decedents. The burden of the estate tax is borne by
them only if the tax prompts them to reduce their lifetime consumption and
accumulate a larger estate, so that the tax can be paid without reducing the
after-tax bequests left to their heirs. In other words, the estate tax must
reduce lifetime consumption and promote estate accumulation for it to be
borne by the decedents.
This condition is unlikely to hold. Because the estate tax makes estate
building less attractive, it probably reduces the size of bequests. Empirical
research confirms that the estate tax reduces the amount that decedents
accumulate and pass on to their heirs. As a first step, it would make more
sense to distribute the burden of the tax to heirs rather than to decedents.
Despite what one might expect, the heirs of wealthy decedents are not
always wealthy. Economists have found that the correlation between the
long-term labor earnings of successive generations is around 0.4 or 0.5. The
correlation between long-term incomes (which includes the inheritances
themselves) or between long-term consumption levels of successive generations has been estimated to be around 0.7. (Correlation is a number, ranging
from -1 to 1, that measures the strength of the relationship between two
variables. A correlation of 0.4 or 0.7 indicates that one variable tends to
increase when the other increases, but that the relationship is not perfect.)
Some bequests are left to grandchildren or nephews and nieces where the
correlation between the incomes of decedents and the incomes of heirs may
be even lower. Because heirs can be less wealthy than decedents, recognizing
that the estate tax burden is more likely to fall on the former reveals that less
of the burden is borne by the very wealthy.
A more important point, however, is that the reduction in estate building
induced by the tax is likely to take the form of a reduction in capital accumulation. Because the estate and gift taxes are taxes on capital, part of their
long-run burden is likely to be shifted to workers through a reduction in
wage rates, as discussed above. Part of the burden is therefore likely borne by
ordinary workers who never receive a bequest or taxable gift.

Conclusion
Distributional analysis can be a useful tool for policy makers. It is important,
however, to recognize the limitations of existing analyses. Current analyses
can be misleading, particularly with respect to the estate and gift taxes and
other capital taxes. These taxes are likely to be shifted substantially to
workers in the long run, reducing the extent to which their burden falls on
high-income groups.

Dynamic Revenue and Budget Estimation

A

central conclusion of the study of taxation is that taxes affect behavior and
distort the choices of firms, workers, and investors. In particular, a higher
tax on an activity tends to discourage that activity relative to others. These
behavioral responses to a tax change can, among other things, alter the revenue
effect of the tax change, a topic that is the focus of this chapter. Revenue estimation is called dynamic if it incorporates the revenue implications of
behavioral responses to tax changes and static if it does not incorporate these
revenue implications. Like changes in taxes, changes in government spending
can encourage or discourage certain behavior; budget estimates are dynamic if
they incorporate the budgetary implications of these behavioral responses.
If policy makers are to make informed decisions about policy changes, all
significant effects should ideally be included in estimates of the policy’s budgetary implications. Several obstacles have prevented macroeconomic behavioral
responses from being incorporated in such estimates. This chapter discusses the
ongoing efforts to provide a greater role for fully dynamic revenue and budget
estimation in the analysis of major tax and spending proposals.
The key points in this chapter are:
• Currently, official revenue estimates of proposed tax changes are not fully
static because they incorporate the revenue effects of many microeconomic
behavioral responses. These estimates are not fully dynamic, however,
because they exclude the effects of macroeconomic behavioral responses.
• Changes in taxes and spending generally alter incentives for work, investment, and other productive activity. These macroeconomic behavioral
responses have revenue and budgetary implications.
• Steps have recently been taken to provide more information about the
revenue effects of macroeconomic behavioral responses. At least in the near
term, it may not be practical for macroeconomic effects to be incorporated
in official estimates. But estimates of these effects should be provided as
supplementary information for major tax and spending proposals.
• Dynamic estimation of policy changes should distinguish aggregate
demand effects from aggregate supply effects, include long-run effects,
apply to spending as well as tax changes, reflect the differing effects of
various policy changes, account for the need to finance policy changes,
and use a variety of models.

117

Revenue Estimation and
Microeconomic Behavioral Responses
To frame the issues, it is useful to begin with a simple example of how a
tax change can affect behavior and how the behavioral response then alters
the revenue impact of the tax change.

An Example of Revenue Implications of
Microeconomic Behavioral Responses
Consider an excise tax on apples (similar to that discussed in Chapter 4,
Tax Incidence: Who Bears the Tax Burden?). If the current tax rate is 25 cents
per apple and 1,000 apples are produced and consumed at this tax rate, tax
revenue is $250. Now, suppose the tax rate is cut to 20 cents per apple. If
apple output and consumption don’t change, total tax revenue falls to $200,
a decrease of $50. Therefore, a purely static estimate of the revenue loss
would be $50.
The actual change in tax revenue is likely to be different, however, because
consumers and producers respond to the tax rate change. The tax rate drives
a wedge between the price paid by consumers (including the tax) and the
price that producers receive (net of the tax). When the tax rate is reduced, this
wedge is reduced, meaning that consumers are likely to pay a lower price and
producers are likely to receive a higher price. For example, at the 25-cent tax
rate, consumers might pay $1.13 per apple and producers might receive
88 cents per apple; at the 20-cent tax rate, consumers might pay $1.10 and
producers might receive 90 cents. The lower price paid by consumers induces
them to consume more apples and the higher price received by producers
induces them to produce more apples. As explained in Chapter 4, the
changes in the two prices must be such that consumers’ desired increase in
consumption equals producers’ desired increase in production.
Suppose that 1,100 apples are produced and consumed at the lower tax rate.
(The actual increase in the quantity of apples depends on how responsive
consumers and producers are to their respective prices; the increase is larger
when both groups are more responsive.) Tax revenue is then $220 (20 cents
per apple times 1,100 apples), not $200. Thus, the tax cut lowers revenue by
$30, not $50. Of the $50 static revenue loss, $20 is “paid for” by the increase
in apple production and consumption caused by the tax cut. In other words,
40 percent of the tax cut “pays for itself” through this revenue feedback.
Conversely, increasing the tax from 25 cents to 30 cents yields $50 of
additional revenue if the quantity of apples remains at 1,000. However, the
quantity of apples is likely to fall as the tax rate increases. With the higher
tax, consumers pay a higher price and producers receive a lower price,
118 | Economic Report of the President

prompting a decline in the desired levels of apple production and consumption. If the quantity of apples falls from 1,000 to 900, revenue rises from
$250 to $270, so that the revenue gain from the tax rate increase is $20
rather than the $50 that would occur with no behavioral response.
The actual revenue effects of such a tax change may be more complex than
this discussion suggests. As the quantity of apples changes, the quantities of
other items produced and consumed also change. If those items are also
subject to taxes, changes in those quantities also impact revenue. In any
event, behavioral responses to a tax change can alter its revenue impact.

Incorporation of Microeconomic Behavioral Responses
in Revenue Estimation
The insight that microeconomic behavioral responses to tax changes affect
revenue has been incorporated into the official revenue-estimation process.
The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) prepares the official
revenue estimates for thousands of proposed tax changes submitted by
members of Congress each year. Similarly, the Department of the Treasury
prepares official revenue estimates for tax changes proposed by the President
and some changes considered by the Congress. Official estimation of the
revenue effect of a tax change is commonly called scoring. Each revenue estimate presents the estimated change in revenues in the current fiscal year and
up to 10 subsequent fiscal years, a period referred to as the “10-year window.”
In preparing their estimates, JCT and Treasury economists routinely
include the effects of microeconomic behavioral responses to tax changes. For
example, when excise taxes change, JCT and Treasury estimates reflect how
much sales of the taxed item are expected to change. So, official revenue estimates for the hypothetical apple tax change described above would reflect an
estimate of the change in the quantity of apples. For changes in the tax treatment of a particular type of business investment, the revenue estimates reflect
shifts between that type of investment and other types.
Changes in the capital gains tax rate provide another example of how
behavioral changes play a prominent role in the scoring process. Economic
theory and statistical studies have established that capital gains taxes deter
realization of capital gains—the sale of assets that have risen in value. A cut
in the capital gains tax rate, therefore, is likely to spur an increase in capital
gains realizations. Put simply, investors are likely to sell their assets to take
advantage of the lower tax rate on any gains they have already accrued. This
increase in realizations will mean that the capital gains tax will be applied to
a larger tax base, partially offsetting the cut in the tax rate itself. Indeed,
depending on the timing and structure of the rate cut, it may actually raise
revenue immediately after enactment. JCT and Treasury estimates recognize
these effects.
Chapter 5

| 119

Economists’ understanding of—and data on—human behavior is
incomplete. This makes it difficult to determine the exact magnitude of
behavioral responses to tax changes and their exact impact on tax revenues.
Nevertheless, a revenue estimate that ignores such behavioral responses will
be inaccurate. By taking account of microeconomic behavioral responses,
the JCT and Treasury produce estimates that are likely to be more accurate
than strictly static estimates.

Macroeconomic Behavioral Responses
to Policy Changes
Despite advances in making revenue estimates more dynamic, the
incorporation of behavioral responses has been subject to one fundamental
limitation. The official revenue estimates assume that macroeconomic aggregates, such as total investment, total labor supply, and GDP, are not affected
by tax and spending changes. Because the estimates ignore these potentially
important effects, they are not fully dynamic.
Lowering taxes on labor and capital income strengthens incentives to
work and invest and is likely to spur increases in these activities. Additional
work and investment boosts national income, which increases the tax base
and thus partially offsets the revenue loss from lower tax rates.
As an example, suppose that the current income tax rate is 25 percent and
that total national income is $1,000. Total tax revenue is $250. Now,
suppose the tax rate is cut to 20 percent. If total income did not change,
total tax revenue would be $200. The lower tax rate, however, is likely to
encourage work and saving, boosting total income. If income rises to
$1,100, total tax revenue will be $220, not $200. Thus, the tax cut lowers
total tax revenue by $30, not $50. In other words, 40 percent of the tax cut
($20 of the $50 static revenue loss) “pays for itself.”
Popular attention is often focused on the possibility that an income tax
rate cut could stimulate so much additional income that it would fully pay
for itself. Most economists believe that, starting from current U.S. tax rates,
such an outcome is unlikely for a broad-based income tax change. It is
important to realize, however, that any behavioral response alters the size of
the revenue loss from a tax cut, even if it does not transform the loss into a
revenue gain.
Official scoring of income tax rate changes already includes a number of
microeconomic behavioral responses. The scoring takes into account a

120 | Economic Report of the President

variety of ways in which the rate cut may raise taxable income, such as a shift
from tax-exempt fringe benefits to taxable wages. However, the estimates do
not recognize that lower income taxes can encourage greater labor supply
and capital accumulation, and thereby raise total income in the economy.
The exclusion of macroeconomic behavioral responses from official
revenue estimation is not due to ignorance of these responses or disagreement about their existence. Instead, it reflects the judgment that accurately
including these effects is impractical, due to the controversy about their
magnitudes and the complexity of modeling them. Uncertainty about the
correct model of the economy and the size of behavioral responses to tax
changes, and disagreement about the appropriate time frame for revenue
projections has made consensus difficult to achieve.
Ultimately, it may be possible for macroeconomic effects to become part
of the official scoring process for those tax and spending proposals that are
likely to have significant macroeconomic effects. However, given the time
and resource constraints facing revenue estimators and the lack of consensus
about these issues, that goal is not likely to be feasible in the near future. To
promote informed policy making, though, it is essential that fully dynamic
revenue estimates (incorporating macroeconomic as well as microeconomic
effects) be presented as supplementary information for major tax and
spending proposals.
Recently, estimators have taken major steps in precisely this direction. In
November 1997, the JCT compiled and published estimates of the macroeconomic effects of fundamental tax reform prepared by nine sets of
economists using nine different economic models. The JCT subsequently
began developing its own macroeconomic models and formed a blue-ribbon
panel of academic and private-sector economists to further explore dynamic
revenue estimation. In January 2003, the House of Representatives adopted
Rule XIII.3(h)(2), which requires the JCT to prepare analyses of the macroeconomic effects of major tax bills before such bills can be considered by the
House. In May 2003, the JCT prepared such an analysis of the Ways and
Means Committee’s version of the Jobs and Growth tax bill. In December
2003, the JCT published a description of the methodology it used for this
analysis. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) provided a similar
analysis of the President’s 2004 Budget in March 2003 and provided a more
detailed description of its analysis in a July 2003 technical document.
Private organizations have also prepared dynamic analyses of proposed tax
changes that reflect macroeconomic behavioral responses

User’s Guide to Dynamic Revenue
and Budget Estimation
Recent work suggests six guidelines for dynamic revenue and budget
estimation.

Guideline 1: Dynamic Estimation Should Distinguish
Aggregate Demand Effects and Aggregate Supply Effects
Tax cuts can affect output through two different channels, by changing
aggregate demand and by changing aggregate supply. Any aggregate demand
effects are likely to be concentrated in the first few years. Aggregate supply
effects are likely to occur over a longer time period.
Changes in Aggregate Demand
In the short run, tax cuts may push an underperforming economy back
toward its potential by raising consumers’ disposable incomes and, thus,
their demand for goods and services. Tax cuts may also increase firms’
demand for investment goods. These effects increase the aggregate demand
for goods and services.
The extent of the increase in aggregate demand depends upon how the tax
cut is financed. If the tax cut is accompanied by reductions in government
spending, little or no stimulus to aggregate demand is likely to occur. If the
tax cut is financed by borrowing, then aggregate demand is more likely to
be stimulated.
The net effect of a tax cut on aggregate demand also depends upon the reaction of the Federal Reserve. If taxes are cut in an under-performing economy,
the Federal Reserve may perceive less need for interest-rate reductions. In such
a case, the boost to aggregate demand from a tax cut would, at least in part,
be offset by the reduced stimulus provided by the Federal Reserve.
The Federal Reserve is less likely to offset the aggregate demand stimulus
from tax cuts, however, in a low-interest-rate economy, because interest rates
cannot go below zero. Under these circumstances, the fiscal stimulus
provided by a tax cut may reinforce, rather than replace, monetary stimulus.
This case seems relevant for the 2003 tax cut; the Federal Reserve’s target for
the Federal funds interest rate was 1.25 percent from November 6, 2002, to
June 25, 2003, and has since remained at 1 percent.
Aggregate demand effects are primarily relevant in the short run. These
effects tend to fade over time as prices and wage rates adjust and the
economy returns to its normal level of output. The bulk of the aggregate
demand stimulus from a policy change is likely to be felt within a few years.

122 | Economic Report of the President

Changes in Aggregate Supply
Tax cuts can raise after-tax returns to work and investment, encouraging
both activities. This effect increases aggregate supply because it increases the
amount of goods and services that the economy is capable of producing.
Tax changes can also improve the long-run allocation of resources, allowing
greater output to be produced with a given set of resources. One way to do
this is to make tax rates more uniform across different types of income, as
exemplified by the reduction in dividend and capital gains tax rates adopted
in the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. This provision
reduced the tax burden on investment in the corporate sector, which was
more heavily taxed than investment in the noncorporate sector. Over time,
this tax reduction is expected to make the allocation of resources more efficient, leading the economy to allocate more resources to the corporate sector.
Because some commercially available forecasting models tend to emphasize
short-run aggregate demand effects, it may be necessary to develop models
that place greater emphasis on long-run aggregate supply effects. In their
recent dynamic analyses, the CBO and the JCT used a mix of models with
varying emphases on short-run and long-run effects. The time frame over
which tax revenues are estimated should be long enough to fully capture the
longer-run, supply-side effects, which leads us to the second guideline.

Guideline 2: Dynamic Estimation Should Include
Long-Run Effects
While official revenue scoring is confined to a 10-year “window,” it is
important that dynamic revenue estimation provide some information for a
longer horizon. Presenting the dynamic revenue estimates as supplementary
information, rather than as part of the official revenue estimate, facilitates
the use of a longer horizon.
The longer horizon is necessary because exclusive use of the 10-year
horizon skews the emphasis given to different macroeconomic effects. As
discussed in guideline 1, aggregate demand effects are likely to be fully realized within the 10-year window but have little long-run importance. In
contrast, aggregate supply effects may not fully materialize within the 10-year
window: Although changes in labor supply may occur relatively quickly,
changes in the capital stock occur more slowly.
Economic analysis indicates that, in a closed economy, such capital accumulation takes place over a period of decades. Consider an example in which
the government cuts taxes slightly on capital income, starting from a
25 percent marginal tax rate. If standard parameter values are assumed for a
leading model of economic growth (the Ramsey growth model used in
Chapter 4 and described in the Appendix to this chapter), only 42 percent
Chapter 5

| 123

of the long-run increase in the capital stock is put in place within the first
10 years. That is, more than half of the increased capital stock accumulates
outside the conventional 10-year window. In fact, only two-thirds of the
increase takes place within 20 years. In an open economy, international
capital flows may allow the capital stock to adjust somewhat more quickly.
Still, this analysis indicates the importance of considering a long time
horizon when estimating a tax cut’s effect on aggregate supply.
A longer time horizon would give adequate emphasis to the tax cut’s
aggregate supply effects. It would also permit policy makers to accurately
compare the fundamental consequences of different types of tax and
spending changes. This leads to the third and fourth guidelines.

Guideline 3: Dynamic Estimation Should Be Applied
to Spending Changes as well as Tax Changes
The logic behind dynamic estimation applies to spending as well as tax
changes. As discussed more fully in guideline 4, spending programs can also
affect aggregate demand and aggregate supply. To be sure, dynamic budget
estimation for spending changes can be even more difficult, and has been
less common, than dynamic revenue estimation for tax changes.
Nevertheless, including macroeconomic effects only for tax changes would
lead to an unbalanced and misleading comparison of policies.

Guideline 4: Dynamic Estimation Should Reflect the
Differing Macroeconomic Effects of Various Tax and
Spending Changes
Not all types of taxes or spending programs would be expected to have the
same effects on the economy. Moreover, the policies that may have the most
beneficial effects in the short run (because they provide a powerful boost to
aggregate demand) can, in some cases, be the least beneficial, or even
harmful, in the long run (because they fail to boost aggregate supply by
increasing work and investment).
In the short run, the most immediate stimulus may be provided by an
increase in government purchases of goods and services, an increase in
transfer payments, or by tax cuts designed to boost consumer spending.
These policies, however, are generally not the best ways to boost aggregate
supply. Although some spending programs, such as infrastructure construction and education, may increase economic growth, others, particularly
some transfer payments, would be expected to reduce aggregate supply by
weakening incentives to work and invest.
In the long run, the strongest boost to aggregate supply is likely to come
from tax cuts designed to boost investment. Tax cuts on capital income are
124 | Economic Report of the President

most likely to have this effect. Their short-run revenue feedback may be
small (because their aggregate demand effects may be limited), but their
long-run revenue feedback may be large.
Consider again the example discussed above, in which the government
cuts capital taxes slightly, starting from a 25 percent marginal tax rate. Using
the same assumptions as before (as detailed in the Appendix to this chapter),
increased growth resulting from the tax cut significantly moderates its
revenue loss. This is particularly true in the very long run (after 50 years or
so), as the economy settles back toward equilibrium. At that point, the
reduction in tax revenues is about half of what conventional scoring would
indicate. The estimated revenue feedback is so large for two reasons: the
policy being considered is a reduction in the capital tax rate and the estimate
refers to the very long run.
It is also possible for some tax cuts to reduce the incentive to work and
save. In this case, the revenue loss from the tax cut is larger than it would
have been without macroeconomic behavioral changes. A prime example is
an increase in a tax credit or deduction that is phased out as income rises.
Such a phase-out is another form of a higher marginal tax rate on income.
For example, married couples filing jointly lose $5 of tax credits per child for
each $100 of additional income above $110,000. For a couple with two
children, this phase-out increases their effective marginal income tax rate by
10 percentage points. Given the existence of the phase-out, any increase in
the size of the credit lengthens the interval of income to which this higher
marginal tax rate applies. As with any increase in marginal income tax rates,
parents in this income bracket have less incentive to work, save, or otherwise
increase their income. This outcome does not mean that increasing the child
credit is a bad idea. The President proposed such increases in 2001 and 2003
and advocates making the increases permanent. As long as the income
phase-out remains in place, however, revenue estimates for increases in the
credit should include the revenue lost because of the reduction in the
parents’ work and saving.
Dynamic estimation is not accurate unless it includes all of the
policy changes that are required to support the tax change. This leads to our
fifth guideline.

Guideline 5: Dynamic Estimation Should Account For
the Need to Finance Policy Changes
Because the government is a going concern, it need never actually pay off
its outstanding debt. Nevertheless, government debt cannot indefinitely
grow faster than national income. One implication of this constraint is that,
over the entire time frame of the economy’s existence, the present value of
tax revenue must equal the present value of noninterest government
Chapter 5

| 125

spending. (Present value takes into account the time value of money—the
fact that monetary sums can earn interest over time.) In the long run, there
can be no “unfunded tax cuts” or “unfunded spending increases.” If current
tax revenue is reduced while current spending is left unchanged or if current
spending is increased while current revenue is left unchanged, government
debt increases. Servicing this debt requires that future taxes be higher, future
spending be lower, or both.
To be sure, it is infeasible for estimators to accurately predict which
adjustments future Congresses and Presidents may adopt. Nevertheless, to
avoid analyzing economically impossible policy specifications, dynamic
revenue estimates should recognize that some such adjustments must occur.
To ensure comparability across proposals, it may be best to adopt a few stylized assumptions about the nature of the financing. A few benchmark cases
could then be considered; perhaps one in which the debt service is financed
with reductions in government purchases, one in which it is financed with
reductions in transfer payments, and one in which it is financed with higher
income tax rates.
How a tax cut is financed can alter its effects in the short run and the long
run. If current revenues are reduced through a tax cut while current
spending is held fixed, the government’s budget deficit will get larger. Such
a deficit-financed tax cut has a strong positive effect on aggregate demand
because consumers are likely to spend part of the tax cut and there is no
offsetting reduction in government spending. It may do somewhat less to
boost aggregate supply, however, if the deficit raises interest rates and, as a
result, lowers investment. This effect is often called crowding-out, because a
government’s deficit spending reduces, or crowds-out, the amount of savings
available for private firms to use for funding investment. On the other hand,
if current spending is reduced along with current revenue, the aggregate
demand effects of the tax cut are muted, because the spending cuts lower
aggregate demand. The boost to aggregate supply is greater, however,
because no crowding-out occurs.
To maximize the aggregate supply impact of the recent tax cuts, the
President has stressed the need to restrain government spending.

Guideline 6: Dynamic Revenue Estimation Should
Use a Variety of Models Until Greater Consensus
Develops
One challenge facing estimators is that different models yield different
results. Comparing the results from different models is the best way to
resolve differences between possible approaches and to test the sensitivity of
results to changes in assumptions. To improve our ability to distinguish
126 | Economic Report of the President

among models, a set of models could be applied to clearly defined and relatively simple hypothetical policies. This would allow the different models’
results to be compared and would make it easier to attribute any variation
among their results to differences in their assumptions. As mentioned above,
the JCT did such an exercise in 1997 when exploring the possible effects of
fundamental tax reform. The CBO and the JCT also used a variety of
models in their dynamic analyses in 2003. Presenting dynamic revenue estimates as supplementary information rather than as part of the official
revenue estimates facilitates the use of a variety of models.
One reason that dynamic revenue estimation is subject to so much
uncertainty is that fiscal changes may have important effects that are left out
of standard models of economic growth. For example, standard growth
models take the rate of technological progress as given. Some research,
however, has suggested that technological progress may be a by-product of
capital accumulation; if so, changes in capital income taxes can alter the rate
of technological progress. As another example, standard models take the
economy's equilibrium level of unemployment as given. Yet some research
has indicated that the equilibrium unemployment rate depends on productivity growth, which can also be influenced by changes in capital taxation.
Incorporating such nonstandard effects into dynamic revenue estimation is
undoubtedly a formidable challenge, but if initial results on these effects are
confirmed by future research, this challenge should not be avoided.

Conclusion
Fully dynamic revenue estimation that incorporates macroeconomic
behavioral changes is an important step forward in applying economic
insights to policy analysis. Significant progress has been made on this front;
continued progress is essential to sound policy making.

Appendix: The Model Used in the Capital-Tax
Example
The model underlying the capital-tax example is the growth model
developed by Frank Ramsey in 1928. It is a leading textbook model, and
most of its assumptions are standard among models of economic growth. For
instance, output is produced by combining capital and labor, and productivity growth increases how much output a given amount of capital and labor
can produce. Consumers maximize their welfare by deciding how much of
their income to save. Businesses maximize profit and compete when hiring
workers and selling products. Over the long term, the saving rate determines
the capital stock and, thus, the level of output in the economy. The Ramsey
Chapter 5

| 127

model allows consumers to choose their saving rate, while simpler models
impose a constant saving rate estimated from historical data.
Unlike some other models, the Ramsey model assumes that consumers are
members of families comprised of an infinite number of generations and that
they care about the well-being of their descendants. This means that consumers
consider the effects of their choices on their children and subsequent generations. Some critics of the Ramsey model view this assumption as unreasonable.
However, the results presented in the text do not change substantially if we
assume that people care less about each successive generation and, for generations far enough into the future, hardly consider their welfare at all.
In the Ramsey model, the long-run equilibrium for the economy can be
described by two relationships. Firms invest in capital equipment until the
value of the output produced by the last unit of capital equipment just
equals the interest rate—the cost borne by the firm to invest. The interest
rate is, in turn, determined by consumers’ choices about their consumption
and savings. These choices depend on the growth rate of technology, the
discount rate (a measure of how much consumers prefer having a dollar
today compared to a dollar in one year), and consumers’ flexibility with
regard to spending in different time periods. To solve the model, we must
make an assumption about how the government finances policy changes in
the long run. In the capital-tax example, we assume that the government
adjusts transfer payments accordingly.
Knowing this long-run equilibrium allows us to calculate the impact of a
cut in tax rates on tax revenue taking into account the aggregate dynamic
effects that this chapter has described. In particular, we can summarize the
difference between a dynamic analysis and a static analysis with a few key
parameters, or inputs, to the model. We assume that the tax rates on labor
and capital income are each 25 percent, capital’s share of total income is onethird, and the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor is one.
Then, if dynamic effects are considered, a capital tax cut reduces tax revenue
in long-run equilibrium by half as much as a static analysis would indicate.

Restoring Solvency to Social Security

M

uch of the Federal government’s budget is dedicated to entitlement
programs, in which expenditures are determined not by discretionary
budget allocations but by the number of people who qualify. Reform of entitlement programs remains the most pressing fiscal policy issue confronting
the Nation. With projected expenditures of $478 billion in 2003, Social
Security is the largest entitlement program and an appropriate place to begin.
Social Security is designed as a pay-as-you-go system in which payroll taxes on
the wages of current workers finance the benefits being paid to current
retirees. While the program is running a small surplus at present, large deficits
loom in the future. Deficits are first projected to appear in 15 years; by 2080,
the Social Security deficit is projected to exceed 2.3 percent of GDP.
The coming deficits in Social Security are driven by two demographic shifts
that have been in progress for several decades: people are having fewer children and are living longer. The President has called for new initiatives to
modernize Social Security to contain costs, expand choice, and make the
program secure and financially viable for future generations of Americans.
This chapter assesses the need to strengthen Social Security in light of its
long-term financial outlook. The key points in this chapter are:
• The most straightforward way to characterize the financial imbalance in
entitlement programs such as Social Security is by considering their longterm annual deficits. Even after the baby-boom generation’s effect is no
longer felt, Social Security is projected to incur annual deficits greater
than 50 percent of payroll tax revenues.
• These deficits are so large that they require a meaningful change to Social
Security in future years. Reform should include moderation of the
growth of benefits that are unfunded and can therefore be paid only by
assessing taxes in the future. A new system of personal retirement
accounts should be established to help pay future benefits. The benefits
promised to those in or near retirement should be maintained in full.
• The economic rationale for undertaking this reform in an era of budget
deficits is as compelling as it was in an era of budget surpluses.

129

The Rationale for Social Security
All developed countries and most developing countries have publicly
administered programs to provide benefits for the elderly, including
programs to support surviving spouses and the disabled. Government
involvement in markets for goods or services is typically predicated on a
failure of private markets to achieve an efficient or equitable result. There are
three main problems in the market for providing support to the elderly that
justify a government role in old-age entitlement programs.
First, a strictly private market to support old age would require all individuals
to choose the level of consumption that they would like in retirement and
to save accordingly. Some individuals may not be capable of making the relevant calculations themselves and may not be able to enlist the service of a
financial professional to advise them. For these people, Social Security
provides a minimal level of financial planning. Social Security requires
people who otherwise would not save for retirement to participate in a
system that makes them pay for insurance against old-age poverty. It also
provides a mechanism for everyone to share in the burden of taking care of
those who are truly in need of assistance.
Second, well-being in retirement is subject to two types of risk that are not
easily insured in private markets. The first risk is low income during working
years, which can lead to poverty in old age. Low income may be caused by
a specific event like disability, and Social Security provides workers with
disability insurance. Private disability insurance plans exist but participation
is quite low. Low income may also be caused by other events beyond an individual’s control. However, these events do not lend themselves to private
insurance contracts because income can also be low for a variety of reasons
that are under an individual’s control but that are difficult for an insurer to
observe (such as low work effort). Social Security partially overcomes this
problem through its progressive benefit formula—retirees with lower earnings during their working years get benefits that are higher as a share of
preretirement earnings.
The other risk to well-being in old age is the possibility that retirees will
live an unusually long time and thereby exhaust their personal savings. To
protect against this risk, a portion of the retirement wealth that a worker has
accumulated must be converted to an annuity, a contract that makes scheduled payments to the individual and his or her dependents for the remainder
of their lifetimes. The annuity payments should be indexed to inflation, so
that their purchasing power is not eroded over time. Inflation-indexed annuities are a fairly new financial product, and even today, relatively few people
participate in the indexed annuity market. A public system of Social
Security, in which the government pays benefits in the form of an annuity
130 | Economic Report of the President

that keeps pace with the cost of living, can help protect retirees from
outliving their means to support themselves.
Third, in other contexts, the government’s fiscal policies are designed to
redistribute resources from high- to low-income individuals. In most cases,
such as the progressive income tax schedule, income is defined based on an
annual measure. Social Security is unusual because it can redistribute
income based on a lifetime average of earnings. By doing so, Social Security
more accurately targets these transfers to the people who most need the assistance. Individuals with higher lifetime average earnings receive benefits from
Social Security that are higher in dollar terms, but lower as a percentage of
their earnings, than do those with lower lifetime average earnings.
All of these rationales are legitimate. Whether the U.S. system actually
meets these goals, and whether it does so in an efficient and equitable
manner, however, should be a subject of continued debate. An essential part
of this debate is that none of these rationales require that Social Security be
operated on a pay-as-you-go basis. Long-term solvency can be restored by
advance funding of future obligations through personal retirement accounts.
Personal retirement account proposals can be and often have been designed
to allow for greater protection for surviving spouses and other vulnerable
groups. The President has taken an important step in this debate by making
the modernization and long-term solvency of Social Security a prominent
feature of his Administration’s domestic policy agenda.

Understanding the Financial Crisis
In a pay-as-you-go system like Social Security, the benefits paid to current
beneficiaries are financed largely by the payroll taxes collected from current
workers. In any given year, the system will be in balance when the income
rate equals the cost rate. The income rate is the total amount of tax revenue
collected (from both the payroll tax and the income taxation of Social
Security benefits for moderate- and high-income beneficiaries) divided by
the total amount of payroll on which taxes are levied. The cost rate is the
total amount of scheduled benefits divided by the total payroll on which
taxes are levied. The annual balance is the difference between the income
rate and the cost rate in a given year.
The impending financial crisis in Social Security is due to the rapid
growth in the cost rate relative to the income rate in the future. This growth
is attributable to two demographic factors that have become critically
important over the last half century: people are having fewer children and
living longer in old age. As a result of these lower rates of both fertility and
mortality, the size of the elderly cohort will expand relative to the younger
cohort over time.
Chapter 6

| 131

Chart 6-1 compares the Social Security cost rate with the dependency ratio,
which is the number of beneficiaries per hundred workers. The projections
are based on the intermediate assumptions made by the Social Security
Trustees in their 2003 report. The dependency ratio rises from 30.4 in 2003
to 55.2 in 2080, an increase of 82 percent. Stated another way, the number
of workers paying payroll taxes to support the payments to each beneficiary
will fall from 3.3 workers per beneficiary in 2003 to 1.8 in 2080. With fewer
workers to support each retiree, it is not surprising that the cost rate is
projected to increase, in this case from 10.89 percent of payroll in 2003 to
20.09 percent in 2080. This 84 percent increase is almost identical to the rise
in the dependency ratio. While changes in productivity, immigration, interest
rates, and other factors also affect the long-term solvency of the program,
changes in population structure are at the center of the looming crisis.
Chart 6-2 graphs the single-year projections of Social Security’s income and
cost rates, along with its annual balances. The solid curve that rises over the
period represents the cost rate (this is the same curve as in Chart 6-1). The
dashed line is the projected income rate, which reflects revenue received by the
Social Security trust funds from the payroll tax of 12.40 percent plus a portion
of the income tax on current benefits. Income taxation on benefits currently
being paid generates an amount equal to 0.30 percent of taxable payroll. Thus,

132 | Economic Report of the President

the income rate in 2003 was 12.70 percent. Because the income thresholds at
which Social Security benefits become taxable are not indexed for inflation, a
greater share of benefits become taxable over time as the price level rises. In
2080, income taxation of benefits is projected to generate 1.03 percent of
taxable payroll, resulting in an income rate of 13.43 percent.
The annual balance, the difference between the income rate and the cost
rate, is projected to deteriorate. For 2003, the annual balance is 1.81 percent
of taxable payroll (12.70 – 10.89). The annual balance is graphed at the
bottom of Chart 6-2 as a solid curve that declines over the period. The
substantial increase in the cost rate relative to the income rate in the future
causes this annual balance to change from surplus to deficit by 2018 and to
widen considerably thereafter. In 2080, the annual balance will be
-6.67 percent of taxable payroll (13.43 – 20.09, as reported in the Trustees
Report, with the small discrepancy due to rounding).
Unless the Social Security system is reformed before that time, the payroll
tax would have to rise from 12.40 percent to 19.07 percent to pay all benefits scheduled by current law, even with the assumption that benefit taxation
continues under current law to provide a rising share of program revenues.
Such an increase represents an expansion of the payroll taxes associated with
the program of over 50 percent (Box 6-1).

The annual deficit of 6.67 percent of payroll is the most straightforward
way to represent the long-term fiscal challenge confronting the Social
Security program. To describe a proposed reform as having restored solvency
to Social Security, the reform must greatly reduce or eliminate these annual
deficits. The only desirable way to restore solvency is to do so without

Box 6-1: The Retirement of the Baby-Boom Generation
It is common in public discussions to associate the financial crisis in
Social Security with the approaching retirement of the baby-boom
generation, those born between the years 1946 and 1964. This explanation, however, is only partly correct. The problems confronting
Social Security are more fundamental than the aging of an unusually
large birth cohort. In 2080, for example, the youngest baby boomer
will be 116 years old, and almost all benefits in that year will be paid
to retirees who were born after the baby-boom generation. Even with
virtually no baby boomers among the beneficiaries, Social Security in
2080 is projected to have an annual deficit equal to 6.67 percent of its
payroll tax base.
The retirement of the baby-boom generation does have an important impact on the system’s finances, as can be seen in Chart 6-1. The
period of rapid increase in both the dependency ratio and the cost rate
occurs during the two decades starting roughly in 2008 when the
baby-boom generation becomes eligible for retirement benefits.
Chart 6-2 shows that over this same period, the annual balance in
Social Security will deteriorate by over 5 percentage points of payroll.
If the retirement of the baby-boom generation were the only source of
Social Security’s financial crisis, then the cost rate would begin to
decline as that generation passed away and the dependency ratio fell.
As shown in Chart 6-1, however, the cost rate continues to climb
even as the baby boomers age and pass away. The dramatic increase
in the cost rate associated with the retirement of the baby-boom
generation is, in fact, a permanent transition to an economy in which
a higher ratio of beneficiaries to workers makes pay-as-you-go entitlement programs more expensive to maintain. This transition would be
more apparent already were it not for the presence of the baby-boom
generation in the workforce today. The huge numbers of baby
boomers in the workforce have held down the ratio of beneficiaries to
workers over the past several decades. Judged from this point
forward, the retirement of the baby-boom generation does not cause
the financial crisis; it simply makes the long-term problem in the payas-you-go system appear sooner rather than later.

continued reliance on general revenues. While these numbers are only
estimates and are revised over time, recent efforts by the actuaries at Social
Security to consider the uncertainty in the projections show that there is
essentially no chance that the system will be in balance in the long-term
(Box 6-2).

Box 6-2: Long-Term Projections and Uncertainty
Recent experience with short-term forecasts has shown that there is
considerable uncertainty about how the economy will evolve. That
uncertainty is compounded over the 75-year period that the Social
Security actuaries must consider. Traditionally, the Trustees Report has
included projections based on three different sets of assumptions—low
cost, intermediate cost, and high cost. The low-cost scenario has higher
fertility rates, slower improvements in mortality, faster real wage
growth, and lower unemployment. All of these changes work to reduce
the projected deficits. The high-cost scenario changes the assumptions
in the opposite direction and results in larger projected deficits.
Policy discussions seldom include any mention of the low- and
high-cost scenarios. Part of the reason is that these alternatives are
accompanied by no information on how likely they are to occur. In the
2003 Trustees Report, a new method of dealing with uncertainty was
included in an appendix. The method, called stochastic simulation, is
based on the idea that each of the main variables underlying the
projection (like the interest rate or economic growth rate) will fluctuate around the value assumed in the intermediate scenario. These
fluctuations are modeled by an equation that captures the relationship
between current and prior years’ values of the variable and introduces
year-by-year random variation, as reflected in the historical period. A
stochastic simulation consists of many different combinations of
possible outcomes for the random variables. Each combination generates a unique path for the key financial measures, each one analogous
to the single assumed path generated by the intermediate-cost
scenario. Taken together, these paths represent a wide range of
possible outcomes for Social Security.
Chart 6-3 shows the range of outcomes for the cost rate generated
by the simulation model. These simulations are based on the assumptions and methods in the 2002 Trustees Report, when the deficits
reported in the last year of the projection period (2076) were 1.11, 6.42,
and 14.66 percent of taxable payroll in that year for the low-, intermediate-, and high-cost scenarios, respectively. Each curve, starting with
the lowest, corresponds to a successively higher percentile of the
distribution of outcomes each year. In the last year of the projection

Chapter 6

| 135

Box 6-2 — continued
period, the median cost rate is 20.33 percent of taxable payroll, which
is slightly higher than the value of 19.84 percent based on the intermediate assumptions. Overall, 95 percent of the cost rates are between
14.53 and 28.98 percent of payroll. Thus, the low-cost estimate of 14.24
and the high-cost estimate of 28.51 correspond to very extreme
outcomes in the overall distribution.
Modeling the uncertainty underlying the demographic and
economic components of the projection is a large step forward in
assessing the future obligations of Social Security. The simulation
model used in the Trustees Report likely understates the variation that
is possible for future costs of Social Security. Nonetheless, the simulations show that based on random year-to-year fluctuations, it is highly
improbable that the system will have a cost rate below its income rate
in the long-term. Uncertainty in the underlying projections only
strengthens the case for reform.

Misunderstanding the Financial Crisis
Altough the Social Security program is operated on a largely pay-as-you-go
basis, discussions of the financial condition of the program often focus on the
trust funds out of which benefit payments are made. There are two trust
funds—one for the old-age and survivors benefits and one for the disability
benefits—that will be referred to collectively as the “Social Security trust
fund.” In a year when the government collects more in payroll taxes than it
needs to pay out in Social Security benefits (net of the income taxes on benefits), surplus revenues are allocated to the Social Security trust fund. The trust
fund is held in a portfolio that consists of special-issue Treasury bonds. The
interest rate on the portfolio reflects the yields on long-term Treasury bonds.
In a year when Social Security benefit payments exceed revenues, some of the
bonds in the trust fund must be redeemed to cover the gap.
In the 2003 Trustees Report, the trust fund ratio for the Social Security
program was reported as 288 percent for 2003. The trust fund ratio is the
proportion of a year’s benefit payments that could be paid with the funds
available at the beginning of the year. Thus, a trust fund ratio of 288 percent
means that in 2003, the amount of bonds held in the trust fund could have
been redeemed to cover nearly three years of Social Security benefit
payments. A positive trust fund ratio is the standard way of assessing the
solvency of Social Security at a point in time. A trust fund ratio of 100
percent is considered to be an adequate reserve for unforeseen contingencies,
such as an unexpected drop in payroll tax collections in a particular year.
When the Trustees Report is released, the reaction in the popular press
almost always focuses on the date at which the trust fund is projected to go
to zero as an indicator of Social Security’s financial health. In the 2003
Trustees Report, this date was 2042, and this was widely reported as good
news because the prior year’s report had projected that date at 2041. The
additional year before all of the bonds are redeemed reflects higher annual
balances in Social Security through 2042 than were projected in the prior
year’s report.
Focusing on the date of trust fund exhaustion is inadequate as a measure
of Social Security’s financial health because this date by itself gives no indication of how dire the fiscal situation becomes after the trust fund hits zero.
When the trust fund is projected to be exhausted in 2042, for example, the
gap between the income and cost rates on the Social Security program is
projected to be 4.54 percent of taxable payroll (or 37 percent of the revenues
collected by the payroll tax). If such a gap existed in 2003, it would be nearly
$200 billion. Reform proposals that are based on pushing back the date
when the trust fund is exhausted by a few years will be insufficient to address
Social Security’s long-term financial imbalance.
Chapter 6

| 137

As a means of providing a longer-range summary of the finances of the
program, the Trustees Report also projects the 75-year actuarial deficit in
Social Security. Long-range actuarial projections are made over 75 years
because this is approximately the remaining lifetime of the youngest current
Social Security participants. The 75-year actuarial deficit is equal to the
percentage of taxable payroll that could be added to the income rate for each
of the next 75 years, or subtracted from the cost rate for each year, to leave
the trust fund ratio at 100 percent at the end of the 75-year period.
In the Trustees Report for 2003, this 75-year actuarial deficit was
1.92 percent of taxable payroll using the intermediate assumptions, up from
1.87 percent in the prior year’s report. That is, in order to have one year’s
worth of benefits left in the trust fund in 2077 (the last year of the 75-year
projection period starting in 2003), Social Security payroll taxes would have
to be 14.32 percent each year for 75 years.
The 75-year actuarial deficit is a widely used measure of the system’s
financial condition. However, even this measure understates the long-term
challenge facing Social Security’s finances. Although an increase in the
income rate of 1.92 percentage points in each of the next 75 years leaves the
trust fund with a positive balance at the end of the 75-year period, the trust
fund will rapidly decline to zero in the years after 2077. This occurs because
the payroll tax increase of 1.92 percent does not cover the annual deficits of
over 6.5 percent that are projected for those years.
Relying on the 75-year actuarial deficit as a guide to solvency is only
marginally better than considering the date of trust fund exhaustion. A
reform that purported to close the 75-year actuarial deficit would be sufficient only to push the date of trust fund exhaustion to a year just beyond
the projection period.
The actuarial deficit over any finite period, even one as long as 75 years, can
dramatically understate the financial imbalance in Social Security when the
program’s annual deficits are getting wider over that period. For example, the
2003 Trustees Report estimates that the present value of the unfunded obligations for the program over the next 75 years is $3.5 trillion. In other words, if
this amount of money were available today and invested at the rate of return
that is credited to trust fund assets, it would provide just enough to cover the
program’s deficits over the next 75 years. However, the Trustees Report also
estimates that the present value of the program’s unfunded obligations over the
infinite horizon—the next 75 years and all years thereafter—is $10.5 trillion.
The $7.0 trillion difference reflects the continued annual deficits that persist
after the first 75 years. Thus, the first 75-year period represents only one-third
of the present value of the total shortfall.
A projection period limited to 75 years also biases the discussion of potential
reforms in favor of those that are based on pay-as-you-go, rather than
138 | Economic Report of the President

advanced, funding. Some reform proposals would allow a portion of the
payroll tax to be used to establish voluntary personal retirement accounts
(PRAs). People who establish their own personal retirement accounts would
be able to direct some of their payroll taxes into their PRAs in exchange for
accepting lower benefits from the pay-as-you-go system in retirement. The
additional funding requirements to maintain benefits for current retirees
while allowing some of the payroll tax to be used for personal retirement
accounts for current workers necessarily appear in the first 75 years. However,
much of the benefit of advanced funding—in terms of reduced obligations of
the pay-as-you-go system—occurs outside of the 75-year projection period.
Recognizing that even a 75-year actuarial deficit cannot fully reflect the
long-term financial shortfalls in Social Security, the Trustees have increased
their focus on the annual balance in the last year of the 75-year projection
period as a guide to the financial shortfalls in the program. If the trust fund
ratio is to continue to play a role in discussions of solvency, then, at the very
least, the standard for restoring solvency to the program should be to have
not only a positive trust fund in the terminal year of the projection period,
but also a trust fund that is not declining toward zero in that year.

The Nature of a Prefunded Solution
To restore solvency to Social Security on an ongoing basis, the income and
cost rates cannot be moving apart over time. If the income and cost rates are
moving together at the same level, then there is no need for a large trust fund,
because the program’s annual balance will be roughly zero in each year. As
noted above, the annual deficit is currently projected to grow to 6.67 percent
of taxable payroll by 2080. Only by reducing annual benefits or increasing the
payroll tax (or the income tax on benefits) by a total of 6.67 percent of taxable
payroll can solvency be restored in the long term on a pay-as-you-go basis.
If these benefit cuts or tax increases are not desired, then an alternative is
to allow the gap between the cost and income rates to persist (provided that
it is not increasing over time) and rely on the investment income from a
portfolio of assets to cover the gap. Such a portfolio would have to be accumulated in the intervening years, in order to prefund the difference between
the program’s scheduled obligations and revenues.
In 1983, the last time a major reform of Social Security was undertaken,
the program was changed to begin accumulating annual surpluses in the
Social Security trust fund. In 2003, the trust fund balance was $1.5 trillion.
However, the intervening two decades provide little assurance that the Social
Security surpluses during that time have increased the resources available to
the government as a whole to pay future benefits.
Chapter 6

| 139

The balance in the Social Security trust fund has a clear meaning as an
accounting device. At any point in time, the trust fund balance shows the
cumulative amount of additional revenue—plus interest—the Social Security
program has made available to the Federal government to spend on other
purchases. The special-issue Treasury bonds in the trust fund are IOUs from
the rest of the government to the Social Security program to cover its deficits
in future years. The trust fund balance shows the extent of the legal authority
for the Social Security program to redeem those IOUs in the future.
Administratively, the Social Security program is not authorized to pay benefits unless the trust fund ratio is positive; that is, it can only pay benefits to
the extent that it has been a net creditor to the rest of the government.
The question of what the government has done with the revenues made
available by past Social Security surpluses has important implications for
what the trust fund represents in economic terms and for the design of
Social Security reform. There are two competing conjectures about the
government’s actions. The first is that the surpluses in the Social Security
program have had no effect on the surpluses or deficits in the rest of the
government’s budget. If this is true, every dollar that the government
received from past Social Security surpluses and thus allocated to the trust
fund served to reduce the amount of Treasury bonds held by the public by
a dollar. In the future, drawing down the trust fund when Social Security is
projected to run annual deficits simply involves selling the debt back to the
public so that when the trust fund is exhausted, the amount of debt held by
the public in the future will be the same as it would have been had there not
been any Social Security surpluses. Under this conjecture about government
budget policy, the Social Security surpluses have been a source of higher
national saving and the trust fund represents real resources available to pay
future benefits.
The second conjecture is that the surpluses in the Social Security program
have encouraged the government to run smaller surpluses or larger deficits in
the rest of its budget. If this conjecture is true, the Social Security surpluses
have not been used to repurchase existing Treasury bonds held by the public
but instead have been used to pay for government expenditures, such as
defense, health care, or education. Drawing down the trust fund in future
years will involve selling Treasury debt to the public, as in the first case.
However, unless future government spending is reduced, the debt held by the
public will be higher than it would have been in the absence of Social Security
surpluses by the time the trust fund is exhausted. Under this conjecture about
government budget policy, the Social Security surpluses have not resulted in
higher national saving, and the balance in the trust fund does not represent
additional real resources available to pay future benefits.
Analysts have argued in favor of both of these conjectures. Determining
which one is correct requires making an assumption about what the
140 | Economic Report of the President

government would have done in the counterfactual case that Social Security
had not run annual surpluses. The unified budget deficit (including Social
Security) has been the focus of budget discussions for almost all of the last
two decades. This provides a strong prima facie case that government expenditures outside of Social Security were higher due to the presence of Social
Security surpluses during this period.
Allocating Social Security surpluses to special-issue Treasury bonds in the
trust fund provides no guarantee that future Social Security obligations are
prefunded. It would therefore not be appropriate to simply accumulate
government bonds in a trust fund as a way to restore solvency. One way to
overcome the vagueness in trust fund accounting is to require that the
prefunding occur by allocating a portion of Social Security’s annual revenues
to the purchase of private rather than government securities and to treat
these purchases as annual expenditures of the Federal government. Doing so
would break the link between Social Security surpluses and the issuance of
debt by the Federal government. This would allow the Social Security
program to accumulate a portfolio of financial claims on private sources to
pay for future obligations.
Some simple arithmetic shows the size of the portfolio of private securities
that would be required to close the entire long-term annual deficit in this
manner. Suppose that investments in a portfolio of stocks and corporate bonds
earn a 5.2 percent expected return, net of inflation and administrative costs.
To obtain an income flow of 6.67 percent of taxable payroll (the annual deficit
in 2080) would require a portfolio of assets equal to 6.67/5.2 = 128 percent
of taxable payroll. In 2080, taxable payroll is projected to be 34.7 percent of
GDP, so that the required stock of assets would be equal to 44.5 percent of
GDP. If such a fund existed in 2003, when GDP was estimated to be
$10.9 trillion, the fund would have a value of $4.9 trillion. This calculation
assumes that either taxpayers or beneficiaries will absorb the financial risk associated with investments in corporate stocks and bonds. Repeating the same
arithmetic using a 3 percent real interest rate—the projected return on the
Treasury bonds in the Social Security trust fund—shows that the fund would
have to be $8.4 trillion.
For portfolios of this magnitude, prefunding by investing in private securities
would require that individuals establish their own personal retirement
accounts. To put these figures in some perspective, as of November 2003,
the net assets of all mutual funds in the United States were estimated to be
$7.24 trillion. Thus, in order to cover the annual deficit in 2080 through
prefunding, a portfolio the size of at least two-thirds and possibly more than
100 percent of all mutual funds would have to be accumulated. A portfolio
of this size is simply too large to be administered centrally without political
interference and without disruption to the capital markets.

Chapter 6

| 141

In light of these issues, a Social Security reform plan should have two
components. First, it should restrain the growth of future pay-as-you-go
benefits for those not currently in or near retirement to bring the cost rate
of the program in line with the income rate in the long term. Second, it
should establish personal retirement accounts for each worker. The personal
retirement accounts serve a dual purpose. First, because the accounts can be
located outside of the government’s budget, the accumulation of assets in
these accounts would not provide any impetus for higher government
spending in the non-Social Security part of the budget. Second, the personal
retirement accounts would provide a way for individual workers to accumulate assets to offset the reduction in their total retirement income that
otherwise would occur due to the lower benefits in the pay-as-you-go part
of the system.

Can We Afford to Reform Entitlements?
While Social Security’s long-term solvency has been an ongoing concern
for over 25 years, the report of the 1994-1996 Advisory Council on Social
Security prompted a new round of policy discussions that included serious
proposals to prefund future obligations with private securities. These discussions were bolstered by the appearance of surpluses in the Federal
government’s budget and budget forecasts during the late 1990s. Shortly
after the President took office in 2001, a bipartisan commission on Social
Security was established. The commission’s final report discusses three
reform options that would involve the use of personal retirement accounts
to prefund a portion of future benefits.
Some critics of personal retirement accounts have suggested that Social
Security reform requires surpluses in the unified budget (including Social
Security) or even the non-Social Security portion of the budget to begin
investing in the accounts while maintaining pay-as-you-go benefits to current
retirees. Since the budget surpluses forecasted a few years ago have not materialized, critics argue that adding personal retirement accounts to Social
Security is impossible or impractical. In reality, the need to add resources to
the Social Security system is no less pressing now that the surpluses have
disappeared; indeed, it may be even more so. The change in the budget
outlook makes reform neither less necessary nor less economically feasible.
As an illustration, consider the recent President’s Commission’s Model 2,
under the assumption that all eligible workers will voluntarily choose to
establish a personal retirement account (thereby maximizing the transition
costs to be discussed below). This plan has two main components. First, it
slows the growth of benefits from the pay-as-you-go system by indexing
142 | Economic Report of the President

future benefits to prices rather than to wages. Prices generally increase more
slowly than wages. Second, the plan allows workers to receive a tax cut now,
if they place the tax cut into a personal retirement account, in exchange for
specific reductions in the pay-as-you-go benefits they would receive otherwise. When workers choose this option, private saving is increased. Under
the conjecture that Social Security surpluses are saved rather than spent,
government saving is reduced and national saving is essentially unchanged.
However, the long-term solvency of the pay-as-you-go system is maintained,
and government and national saving increase to the extent that having
resources go into personal retirement accounts rather than the Social
Security trust fund prevents the government from using Social Security
revenues to pay for non-Social Security expenditures.
The economic rationale for undertaking this type of Social Security
reform does not depend on the current budget situation. This is clearly true
with respect to the first component of reform—restraining the growth of
future pay-as-you-go benefits to a level that is commensurate with future
payroll tax revenues. The value of pursuing this objective does not depend
in any important way on whether, due to prior economic and budgetary
events not related to the reform, future generations will be paying interest
on a large or small stock of public debt. If anything, easing the payroll tax
burden on future generations is more important if they face a greater interest
burden. Relying on personal retirement accounts also remains necessary.
Compared to government saving, saving in personal retirement accounts
gives workers greater freedom to prepare for their own retirement. Saving in
personal retirement accounts also ensures that the additional resources being
accumulated for Social Security are not available to be tapped for additional
government spending.
Even if both components of reform are still necessary, though, are they
feasible? Chart 6-4 shows the plan’s effect on the unified budget deficit and
total government debt held by the public assuming that the first contributions to personal retirement accounts are made in 2004. Even under the
favorable conjecture that Social Security surpluses do not facilitate higher
government spending outside of Social Security, the deficit initially increases,
but then falls as the reform is fully phased in. At its maximum, in 2022, the
incremental deficit increase is less than 1.6 percent of GDP. The higher
deficits in turn lead to a greater stock of debt in subsequent years, followed
by repayment. The maximum increment to the debt is 23.6 percent of
GDP, in 2036.
The hump-shaped pattern for the impact of reform on the deficit reflects
the combined effects of the two parts of the reform. Personal retirement
accounts widen the deficit by design—they refund payroll tax revenues to
workers in the near term while lowering benefit payments from the pay-as-

Chapter 6

| 143

you-go system in later years. After 2048, an incremental surplus emerges as
the benefit reductions phased in through price indexation begin to outweigh
the net effect of the personal retirement accounts on the deficit.
Is this temporary increase in government borrowing a problem? Not from
an economic perspective. The increased borrowing does not shift any
burden to future generations. The tax cuts given to today’s workers are paid
for by reductions in the share of their future benefits that must be paid from
future tax dollars. Nor are current workers harmed. They save this money in
their own accounts, which can give them retirement income just as surely as
if the government were promising it to them.
While the government’s budget situation does not affect the economic
necessity and feasibility of Social Security reform, under some assumptions
about the political constraints on the budget process, the political feasibility
and desirability of reform may be shaped by the overall budget picture.
Reforms will lead to larger unified budget deficits in the near term but
smaller deficits in the long term. The presence of a deficit in the non-Social
Security part of the budget may make it more difficult to persuade
lawmakers to reform Social Security, if the transition costs of the reform
cause the deficit to eclipse a previous record. However, avoiding Social
Security reform will not keep deficits in check. If nothing is done to reform
Social Security, under current projections, the growth of Social Security,

144 | Economic Report of the President

Medicare, Medicaid, and the interest on the borrowing required to finance
their growth will lead to unified budget deficits that surpass previous records
as a share of GDP.
Chart 6-5 shows the projected costs and revenues in the unified budget
under the assumption that no reforms are made to Social Security. The
projections are based on the President’s policies in the fiscal year 2004
budget, modified to include relief from the alternative minimum tax. The
chart assumes that all scheduled Social Security benefit payments are made,
financed through additional debt after the trust fund is exhausted. The
stacked areas represent total scheduled Federal spending as a share of GDP.
Even with nonentitlement spending fixed at 8.1 percent of GDP and
excluding interest payments, Federal spending surpasses 20 percent of GDP
in 2025, 25 percent in 2050, and 30 percent in 2080. The solid line shows
total revenue. The budget deficit, which is the height of the areas above the
black line, grows sharply in upcoming decades.
The impact of Social Security reform on the baseline deficit is shown in
Chart 6-6, which graphs the evolution of the deficit under two scenarios: the
baseline from Chart 6-5 in which no reform is implemented and a reform
that includes all of Model 2, with 100 percent participation. Recall from
Chart 6-4 that this reform causes the budget deficit to increase temporarily
before falling to a lower share of GDP as the reform is fully phased in.

Chapter 6

| 145

With the reform, the unified budget deficit reaches 5 percent of GDP in
2019. Without reform, this deficit is reached instead in 2023. The benefits
of the reform appear over time, making a positive impact on the Federal
budget after 2048.
Policy makers concerned about the unified deficit will have to decide how
they will restrain Federal spending over the upcoming decades—they will
have to confront this question even if nothing is done to reform Social
Security. The benefit of reforming Social Security is that it alleviates, to some
extent, the financial burden that unreformed entitlement programs will
place on future generations.

146 | Economic Report of the President

Conclusion
The Nation must act to avert a long-foreseen future crisis in the financing
of its old-age entitlement programs. The crisis results mainly from the
fundamental demographic shifts to lower birthrates and longer lives rather
than the impending retirement of the baby-boom generation. However, the
scope for enacting meaningful reform will disappear as the baby-boom
generation begins to retire and an ever greater share of the population sees
its current income arrive in the form of a government check. The design of
the Social Security program has failed to keep pace with emerging demographic realities. The benefits promised to those currently in or near
retirement must be honored, but a new course must be set to ensure that
Social Security is viable and available to Americans in the future.
To do nothing at this point to restrain the growth of entitlement programs
would bequeath to future generations an increasing tax on their income to
support Social Security. The only way to avoid such an outcome without
reducing the living standards of future retirees is to save more today. Greater
saving will increase the capital stock and increase the productive capacity of
the economy so that it can support those higher payments. The combination of reducing the projected cost of taxpayer-financed benefits and shifting
the revenues into personal retirement accounts provides the best mechanism
for achieving that result.

Government Regulation in a
Free-Market Society

A

n important reason for Americans’ high standard of living is that they live
in a free-market economy in which competition establishes prices and
the government enforces property rights and contracts. Typically, free markets
allocate resources to their highest-valued uses, avoid waste, prevent shortages,
and foster innovation. By providing a legal foundation for transactions, the
government makes the market system reliable: it gives people certainty about
what they can trade and keep, and it allows people to establish terms of trade
that will be honored by both sellers and buyers. The absence of any one of
these elements—competition, enforceable property rights, or an ability to
form mutually advantageous contracts—can result in inefficiency and lower
living standards. In some cases, government intervention in a market, for
example through regulation, can create gains for society by remedying any
shortcomings in the market’s operation. Poorly designed or unnecessary regulations, however, can actually create new problems or make society worse off
by damaging the elements of the market system that do work.
The key points in this chapter are:
• Markets generally allocate resources to their most valuable uses.
• Well-designed regulations can address cases where markets fail to accomplish
this goal.
• Not all regulations improve market outcomes.

How Markets Work
Free markets work through voluntary exchange. This voluntary nature
ensures that only trades that benefit both parties take place: people give up
their property only when someone agrees to exchange it for something that
they value more highly. In most transactions, sellers receive money rather than
goods in exchange for their property. Sellers then use that money to become
buyers in other transactions.
What ensures that producers are providing the commodities that consumers
want? Market prices play the critical role of coordinating the activities of
buyers and sellers. Prices convey information about the strength of consumer
demand for a good, as well as how costly it is to supply. By conveying information and providing an incentive to act on this information, prices induce

149

society to shift its scarce resources to the production of goods that are valued
by consumers. In this way, markets usually allocate resources in a manner that
creates the greatest net benefits (benefits minus costs) to society. An efficient
allocation is one that maximizes the net benefits to society.
In general, efficiency requires that the price of a good reflects the incremental
cost of producing that good, including the cost of inputs and the value of
the producer's time and effort. In this way, prices induce consumers to economize on goods that are relatively expensive to produce and to increase their
purchases of goods that are relatively inexpensive to produce. A key advantage of free-market competition is that it generally leads to a situation in
which price equals incremental production cost. This outcome occurs
because in a competitive market environment, a seller who charges a price
above the cost of production will be undercut by competitors, including
new entrants. In contrast, if prices are artificially high because of limited
competition, consumers will buy less of the good than they would if they
faced the competitive price. Furthermore, some consumers who would
benefit from buying the good at a competitive price may not buy it at all.
When market conditions change, prices usually change as well and signal
buyers and sellers to modify their behavior. For example, if a disruption in
the gasoline supply were to occur and prices and behavior remained
unchanged, there would not be enough gasoline supplied to satisfy
consumer demand at predisruption prices. The result would be a gas
shortage. To eliminate this shortage, some form of rationing would be
required to ensure that the quantity of gasoline demanded by consumers
matched the quantity of gasoline provided by suppliers.
In a market economy, rationing is done by prices. As prices of gasoline
increase, two changes in behavior typically occur. First, consumers as a
whole reduce their consumption of gasoline, and second, producers as a
whole increase the quantity of gasoline available for sale. These aggregate
changes are the result of many individual decisions. For example, some
consumers may carpool, others may cancel trips, and some may be willing
to spend more on gasoline to continue on as before. On the supply side,
producers may ship gasoline from areas not affected by the supply disruption, refineries may increase production, and firms may lower inventories of
gasoline in storage. Eventually, prices increase to the point at which the
reduced quantity of gasoline demanded equals the increased quantity of
gasoline supplied. In a market economy, all of this happens without any
centralized control mechanism.

Market Imperfections
Sometimes markets do not allocate resources efficiently. Under such
circumstances, it may make sense for the government to intervene in
markets beyond providing a legal foundation for market transactions.
Chapters 8 and 9, which deal with energy and the environment, discuss
some regulations designed to address two such market failures—externalities
and market power. These chapters look at both the benefits and potential
problems that can result from imposition of regulations.
Poorly designed or unnecessary government regulations can actually
reduce society’s overall well-being. The possible costs of government regulation include the costs imposed on consumers and producers, impeded
innovation, and unintended negative consequences such as the creation of
unforeseen barriers to competition. It is essential to consider whether the
costs potential regulations impose on society are greater than the benefits
society receives from fixing any market failures.

Regulation and Externalities
Externalities (also known as spillover effects) can lead to a situation in
which the price of a commodity does not reflect its full incremental cost to
society. A negative externality exists when the voluntary market transaction
between two parties imposes involuntary costs on a third party. For example,
a power plant might produce and sell electricity to consumers to both their
advantage, but the production process might emit air pollution that negatively affects the population. The costs that this pollution imposes on the
population might not be considered when the firm decides where to locate
a plant, which technologies to use, or how much electricity to produce. It
could be that if these costs were taken into account in the same way as all of
the other costs of producing electricity, the plant might be relocated to a
place where its pollution would affect fewer people, the firm might put
greater emphasis on pollution-reducing technologies, or the plant may not
produce as much electricity. The existence of a negative externality can lead
to an outcome that is worse for society than one that takes the externality
into account.
As discussed in Chapter 9, Protecting the Environment, in many cases the
best remedy for externalities is to define property rights and allow the
affected parties to transact privately to achieve a mutually beneficial
outcome. Sometimes, however, establishing property rights can be expensive. Even with clearly defined property rights, it may be costly for affected
parties to collectively agree on a mutually beneficial transaction. Under such
circumstances, other forms of government intervention may be appropriate,
including taxes, subsidies, and direct regulation.
Chapter 7

| 151

Addressing Externalities Through Taxes
One approach to dealing with externalities would be to levy a tax (known
to economists as a Pigouvian tax) on market participants such that the
amount of tax collected equals the incremental cost of the externality. For
example, if a power plant’s emissions are easy to monitor and the costs of
pollution are easy to assess, the tax on each unit of pollution could be set
equal to the cost of the externality. Alternatively, if the amount of pollution
is not easily monitored, the tax could apply to each unit of production (each
kilowatt produced by the plant, for example) rather than the pollution itself,
and could be set equal to the additional external cost of pollution from each
unit of production.
In general, taxes distort economic activity (see the discussion of the
income tax in Chapter 4, Tax Incidence: Who Bears the Tax Burden?).
However, proponents of Pigouvian taxation argue that it can improve the
allocation of resources by forcing producers and consumers to confront the
full costs of production. Indeed, some advocates of the use of such taxes go
further and argue that revenues from Pigouvian taxes could be used to
finance a reduction in the rates on other taxes that do distort behavior, such
as the income tax. This idea is sometimes called the double-dividend hypothesis because it increases efficiency in the market with the externality and in
the markets that are distorted by the income tax.
This argument must be viewed with caution. To see why, recall that
Pigouvian taxes drive up the prices of the goods that are produced using
technologies that involve pollution. The increase in prices reduces the
buying power of households’ incomes. This is effectively a decrease in the
real wage rate because a given dollar amount of wages buys fewer goods and
services. Put another way, Pigouvian taxes are, to some extent, also taxes on
earnings. If the labor market is already distorted because of an income tax
(as is the case in the United States and other industrial economies), the
Pigouvian tax makes the distortion worse. In some cases, the added distortions in the labor market can actually outweigh the gains from correcting the
externality. The desirability of Pigouvian taxes as a policy instrument must
be determined on a case-by-case basis.

Addressing Externalities Through Limits on Quantity
Another possible problem with Pigouvian taxes is that determining their
magnitude can be challenging because it may be difficult to measure the
amount of pollution, as well as the value of the damage it causes. Moreover,
the appropriate tax may change with market conditions. If, for example, the
cost of the externality increases with output, the optimal tax would need to
go up if output increases.

152 | Economic Report of the President

It is also difficult to know beforehand the tax level that will reduce emissions
by the desired amount. Moreover, as the economy changes, the tax will need
to be adjusted to maintain the desired amount of emissions reduction. A
system in which a firm must own a government-issued permit for each unit
of pollution addresses these problems because the government determines the
number of permits to create. A cap-and-trade system, which allows firms to
trade these permits, accomplishes the environmental goal at least cost.

Addressing Externalities Through Subsidies
Another option for dealing with externalities is to subsidize alternative
behaviors that do not produce the negative externality. For example, concern
over externalities from fossil fuels has led to government subsidies of some
alternative sources of electricity, such as wind and solar power. However,
such subsidies have some limitations. First, using the example of electricity,
subsidies encourage overconsumption by keeping the cost of electricity
below the level that market forces would set if the costs of the externality
were taken into account. Second, subsidies raise some difficult administrative issues. In particular, the government needs to identify all the behaviors
that should qualify for a subsidy. In the case of the power plant that emitted
pollution, a fully efficient policy would be to subsidize all other ways of
generating electricity and all conservation activities. Such attempts quickly
become unwieldy in practice.

Addressing Externalities Through Command-and-Control Regulation
The government can also attempt to limit negative externalities with
command-and-control regulations that mandate certain behavior. For example,
the government requires automobile producers to meet overall fuel-efficiency
standards. There have also been proposals to mandate that a certain percentage
of electricity be generated by renewable fuels such as wind and solar power.
Command-and-control regulations can sometimes be the only way to deal
with an externality. In general, however, they should be avoided because they
discourage flexible and innovative responses to externalities and can result in
higher costs than alternative policies. For example, mandating use of a
particular technology to lower emissions could lessen firms’ incentives to
develop more effective techniques to reduce pollution. Furthermore, people
adapt to command-and-control regulations in unintended ways that can
limit their effectiveness over time. For example, one unintended consequence of the automobile fuel-efficiency standards was to increase the
demand for light trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs), which were not as
stringently regulated.

Chapter 7

| 153

Regulation and Market Power
Market power, which arises in the presence of impediments to competition,
is another potential source of inefficiency in a free-market system. Firms that
have market power typically have the ability to charge prices above the
competitive price level and maintain those high prices profitably over a
considerable period. In some cases, the impediment is a law that makes it
difficult for competitors to enter a market, but market power can also arise
from the nature of the industry itself. For example, the high cost of wiring
residential neighborhoods for electricity makes it unlikely that multiple firms
would be willing to compete to distribute retail electricity. In these cases,
regulation can be useful to prevent firms with market power from charging
consumers prices that substantially exceed the cost of providing the good.
Policy makers need to recognize, however, that regulations themselves
affect firms’ and consumers' behavior and incentives. Regulations that do
not take these effects into account can result in excessive consumption,
misaligned incentives, stunted innovation and investment, and needless
waste. Even regulations that do account for these effects may be rendered
obsolete or counterproductive by changes in the industry that occur over
time. For this reason, it is important to periodically reevaluate regulatory
policies. Chapter 8, Regulating Energy Markets, discusses opportunities for
reevaluation in further detail.

Regulation in the Absence of a Market Failure
Some government regulations attempt to reverse what would otherwise be
efficient market outcomes due to beliefs that a particular market-based allocation of resources is undesirable. For example, regulations to prevent “price
gouging” might be seen as fair, but the economic consequences of these
regulations must be recognized (Box 7-1). Attempts to circumvent the
market in this way must confront a basic reality—resources are scarce, so
that if market prices are not used to ration commodities, some other mechanism has to be used instead. For example, resources could be allocated to
consumers using ration coupons, a lottery, or first-come, first-served.
Resources could also be allocated based on cronyism or other discriminatory
means. These nonprice methods cannot guarantee that the scarce resources
go to the consumers who value them the most. Furthermore, they reduce
suppliers’ incentives to increase production. For example, if prices are
capped, suppliers may not work overtime to increase supplies or pay extra
transportation costs to bring in supplies from distant areas. As a result,
resources are not put to their best uses.

154 | Economic Report of the President

Box 7-1: Market Responses to Unexpected Shortages
When there are large, unexpected increases in demand or
decreases in supply for a good, a normal market response is for prices
to increase by enough to restore balance between supply and
demand. Consumers might accuse sellers of “price gouging” when
such price increases occur in response to a natural disaster or a failure
of supply infrastructure. A number of states have laws that make price
gouging illegal. Even without such laws, some businesses might
choose not to increase prices during an emergency for fear of a
consumer backlash. If prices do not increase, however, consumers do
not receive a signal to cut their consumption and suppliers might not
have the proper incentives to increase supply adequately.
By not allowing market forces to restore the balance between
supply and demand after the shock, nonprice rationing must be implemented instead. For example, after a pipeline break reduced the
supply of gasoline into the Phoenix, Arizona, area in August 2003,
press reports indicated that some stations ran out of gasoline,
consumers waited in line for hours, and some drivers started
following gasoline tankers as they made their deliveries.
Changes in demand can induce shortages as well. For example, in
the days leading up to the arrival of Hurricane Isabel in the Mid-Atlantic
states in September 2003, press reports indicated that many retailers
sold out of flashlights and D batteries. The flashlights and batteries
went to the first people to show up at the store, rather than to those
who valued them the most. It also meant that people who were able to
buy the goods might have bought more than they would have at the
higher price, leaving fewer for others. Without price increases, there
was no mechanism to allocate the available goods to their highestvalued uses. For example, if prices were higher, early customers may
have decided not to buy new batteries for their fifth flashlight and later
customers would not have been forced to sit in the dark.
While allowing prices to increase in the face of a natural disaster or
a supply disruption may seem unfair, the alternative would be to
restrict the allocation of scarce supplies and to possibly keep supplies
from those who need them most. Artificially low prices remove incentives for consumers to conserve and for suppliers to meet unfilled
demand, potentially prolonging the shortage. Society must decide
whether the perceived fairness resulting from regulations to hold
down prices is more important than allowing the market to provide
incentives for resolving the shortage as quickly as possible, while
making sure that scarce resources are available for those who value
them the most.

Chapter 7

| 155

Conclusion
In general, market systems allocate resources toward their most highly
valued uses. Importantly, no one directs society to this result. Rather, it is the
outcome of a process in which each consumer and each producer observe
prices and privately make the decisions that maximize their well-being. The
coordination of economic activity is done by prices, which provide signals
of the costs to society of providing various goods. However, in the presence
of market power, externalities, and other types of market failure, marketgenerated prices may not incorporate all of the relevant information about
costs. Under these conditions, there are opportunities for government to
intervene and improve the allocation of resources.
The fact that the market-generated allocation of resources is imperfect
does not mean that the government necessarily can do better. For example,
in certain cases the costs of setting up a government agency to deal with an
externality could exceed the cost of the externality itself. Therefore, proposed
remedies for market failure must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
Energy and the environment are two areas in which government intervention
may play a role in correcting market failures. Such interventions are likely to
be more successful when they harness market forces to the extent possible.
The next two chapters illustrate the challenges in properly designing regulations in these areas. An important implication of the analysis of both
chapters is that in order to make society better off, regulatory policy must be
based on a solid economic foundation.

Regulating Energy Markets

E

nergy is essential to the U.S. economy, both as a final good and as an
input into the production of most other goods. In 2000, energy expenditures equaled $703 billion, or 7.2 percent of GDP. The markets that provide
this energy function well and are generally competitive. However, parts of the
energy industry have characteristics that are associated with market failures.
For example, the large fixed costs required to construct distribution networks
for electricity and natural gas make it unlikely that more than one firm would
be willing to invest in the infrastructure needed to serve residential customers
in a particular area. The distribution company, therefore, may have market
power, the ability to charge prices significantly above the competitive price
level and profitably maintain those prices for a considerable period. Another
type of market failure involves negative externalities, costs that economic transactions impose on third parties that the parties to the transaction do not face.
For example, energy producers and consumers may not fully take into
account the fact that burning fossil fuels may cause acid rain or smog.
This chapter discusses economic issues relevant to several different energy
markets, including natural gas, gasoline, electricity, and crude oil. The use of
these different types of energy involves different market structures and
different potential market failures. An important focus of the chapter is on the
design of regulations to address market failures in energy markets while minimizing disruptions to the market. The key points in this chapter are:
• Markets generally work well for energy products, which in most ways are
like other products in the U.S. economy. While some aspects of energy
markets may require regulation, most segments of these markets function well without regulation.
• Federal, state, and local regulations can have conflicting goals. If the
conflicting goals are not balanced, competing regulations could lead to
worse problems than the market failures the regulations attempt to
address.
• Regulations need to be updated as markets evolve over time to ensure
that the original goals still apply and that these regulations are still the
lowest-cost means of meeting those goals.
• The United States benefits from international trade in energy products.

157

Market Forces and Regulation
in the Market for Natural Gas
Some energy markets require regulation. For example, because of the high
cost of natural gas distribution services, the market generally supports only
one local distribution company. Thus, the delivery infrastructure, including
pipelines and gas meters connected to individual residences, is regulated.
However, certain segments of the natural gas industry are amenable to
competition. They do not require regulation even though the distribution
segment does. Indeed, in many areas of the country parts of the natural gas
market have been deregulated. For example, producers of natural gas are no
longer subject to price regulation. Furthermore, although prices for transporting natural gas to homeowners are regulated, in some states multiple
firms now compete for the right to sell the gas to homeowners. This type of
partial deregulation has also been applied to electricity markets; in many
areas, local distribution lines are still regulated while generation and retail
marketing are deregulated.
The last year has demonstrated how market forces have worked to allocate
scarce resources in the natural gas market. Demand for natural gas is highly
seasonal, with the greatest consumption by far during the winter heating
season. During the summer, a portion of natural gas production is stored for
use in the following winter. Natural gas inventories in spring 2003 were
unusually low after a colder than normal winter in 2002-2003. This led to
large increases in natural gas prices in the spot and futures markets. In turn,
these high prices encouraged consumers to switch to other fuels or reduce
consumption over the summer, encouraged producers to increase production, and encouraged importers to bring in additional natural gas from
outside North America. In combination, these actions resulted in a nearrecord increase in natural gas inventories in time for the winter heating
season. As a result, the United States entered the winter of 2003-2004 with
slightly above-average natural gas inventories. High prices have also given
firms an added incentive to invest in new projects, such as liquefied natural
gas (LNG) facilities, to bring additional supplies of natural gas to the market
in the future.

158 | Economic Report of the President

Market Forces and Regulation
in Gasoline Markets
Recent and past events in the gasoline market have shown how unexpected
shortages affect market prices and how government regulation can make the
situation worse. Wage and price controls imposed in the early 1970s to combat
inflation included government regulations that kept gasoline prices below the
market level. As a result, when oil supplies were disrupted in 1973 and 1979
by geopolitical events in the Middle East, consumers wanted to buy more
gasoline than suppliers were willing to supply at the artificially low prices.
Regulations that prevented suppliers from increasing prices meant that
consumers had to wait in lines or face limits on the amount of gasoline they
could purchase. As a result, some gasoline likely went to consumers who
valued it less than other consumers because those who would have cut
consumption as prices rose continued to buy gasoline at the artificially low
price. Keeping gasoline prices artificially low also reduced the incentive for
oil companies to refine new sources of crude oil into gasoline—a supply
response that would have lessened the shortfall.
Gasoline markets also demonstrate how markets react to unexpected
changes in supply when prices are not regulated. For example, several
refinery problems on the West Coast in recent years have, on occasion,
temporarily reduced the supply of California Air Resource Board (CARB)
gasoline that meets strict California specifications for reducing air pollution.
After these disruptions, prices typically increased quickly, and usually stayed
high for only a matter of weeks. These increased prices led consumers to
reduce their gasoline consumption.
During supply disruptions that were expected to last a relatively long time,
the high prices also led distant refineries to produce and ship CARB gasoline
to California. These refiners had to shift their operations to make CARB
gasoline instead of their normal product, find an available tanker, and then
ship the gasoline to California—a process that takes three weeks or more.
High prices rewarded the refiners that were able to get CARB gasoline to
California quickly, while refiners whose shipments arrived too late (that is, as
prices started to come down again) would lose money. The price spike
provided an incentive for distant refiners to risk making and shipping CARB
gasoline to California, thus helping to alleviate California’s gasoline shortage.

Chapter 8

| 159

Local and Federal Regulations May Conflict
As illustrated in the example above, not all gasoline sold in the United
States is the same. Differences in local specifications are often the result of
how local and state governments have responded to the Clean Air Act of
1990. Chart 8-1 shows which areas of the United States have adopted
different fuel specifications. Flexibility in how localities address air pollution
abatement allows them to implement an approach that best meets their needs.
However, different local or regional gasoline specifications add complexity to
the national gasoline production and distribution infrastructure, reducing the
reliability and availability of gasoline supplies.
The proliferation of fuel varieties produced for various locations (called
boutique fuels) reduces the number of potential suppliers of each particular
fuel and slows the industry response when there are local or regional disruptions to the gasoline supply. Boutique gasoline specifications likely
contributed to the price spike in the Midwest in 2000, which occurred after
several refineries experienced production problems around the same time
that two major pipelines supplying the region went out of service. Chicago
and Milwaukee were particularly hard-hit in part because of their local

160 | Economic Report of the President

requirements for reformulated gasoline using ethanol. Nearby cities using
reformulated gasoline had different specifications, so that existing reformulated gasoline stocks could not be shipped to the area.
The impact of boutique fuel regulations demonstrates that there may be
benefits from standardizing regulations across geographic areas for goods
that are sold regionally or nationally. Gasoline markets in the eastern half of
the United States are interconnected by pipelines, barges, and tankers.
Reducing the number of gasoline specifications could allow for increased
flexibility of the gasoline supply system. For example, production lost
because of a refinery problem in Chicago could be offset by shipments of
gasoline from refiners in other areas. The President’s National Energy Plan
asked the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to study ways to increase
the flexibility of the Nation’s fuel supply.
While there may be benefits from standardizing regulations across
geographic areas, standardization may require some areas to use gasoline that
is more expensive than necessary to meet local air-quality standards. The
benefits of standardization must be weighed against any increased costs.

Local and State Regulations Lead to Different
Market Outcomes
State regulations can also increase the cost of marketing and distributing
gasoline to consumers. For example, several states and the District of
Columbia have divorcement laws that restrict refiners’ ability to own and
operate retail stations. These regulations have been found to increase prices
at the pump; prices in states with divorcement laws are almost 3 percent
higher than they would be without such laws. Similarly, regulations in
Oregon and New Jersey ban self-service gasoline sales because of putative
safety and environmental concerns. Economists have estimated that gasoline
prices in these states are between 2 and 6 cents per gallon higher than they
would be without the self-service ban (gasoline prices in New Jersey are
lower than in surrounding states because of New Jersey’s low gasoline taxes,
but prices would be even lower if self-service were allowed).

Market Forces and Regulation
in Electricity Markets
While a mix of market forces and well-designed regulation can lead a
market with market failures to perform more effectively and efficiently,
improper regulation can lead to worse outcomes than even an imperfect
market without regulation. The market for electricity is a case in point.
Chapter 8

| 161

Some existing regulations in the United States have the unintended effect of
making the Nation’s electricity supply less reliable and more expensive. The
same attribute that makes competition in electricity difficult to achieve—
provision of electricity over a single network on which the amount of
electricity supplied must equal the amount of electricity consumed at every
moment—makes the consequences of poorly designed regulation particularly costly. For example, California’s rolling blackouts in January 2001
appear to have stemmed in part from regulations that fixed retail electric
rates. As a result, there was an insufficient supply of electricity during the
daily peak periods of demand. Fixed retail electric rates provided little incentive for consumers to reduce their consumption of electricity during these
high-usage periods.

The Evolution of the Electric Industry from Local to
Interstate Markets
As the electric industry has evolved from local, largely self-contained
systems to a more national, integrated system, the appropriate combination
of state and Federal regulations has changed as well. For many years, electricity was provided by integrated utilities—local monopolies that generated
power and distributed it to residents and companies in a specific area—that
were regulated by state public utility commissions.
Over time, a high-voltage transmission network linking the local monopolies developed. The network was originally designed to boost reliability, but
it has also had the effect of reshaping the economics of the electricity market.
The existence of this network (called the transmission grid) gave rise to a
market for wholesale electricity through which utilities could buy electricity
generated elsewhere for use by their own customers.
Regulatory changes complemented the technological and structural
changes to make the electricity business more competitive. In 1978, new
Federal regulations mandated by the Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act
(PURPA) required state-regulated utilities to buy power generated using
renewable energy sources and cogeneration plants (plants that produce electricity while producing other products such as steam heating). These
regulations led to an expansion of wholesale markets in which regulated utilities bought electricity generated by other firms and demonstrated that
independent electricity generators could coexist with existing state-regulated
utilities. In the late 1980s, Federal regulators began revising regulations to
encourage the development of independent producers more generally. In
1996, Federal regulators began requiring the public utilities that owned
transmission lines to make them available to independent electricity generators. Today, more than half of all the electricity generated is exchanged on
the wholesale market before it is sold to consumers.
162 | Economic Report of the President

Electricity Regulation in an Evolving Market
Wholesale electricity generation will become more efficient over time as
unregulated generating companies add new capacity based on competitive
market signals. Market signals will influence both the timing of when new
generation capacity is built and the type of fuel these plants will use. For
fully regulated electric utilities, these decisions are made with the approval
of local or state regulators. Without the discipline of competitive markets,
regulated utilities are able to pass increased costs on to consumers regardless
of whether the utilities have made the most efficient choices.

Effects of Regulation on Transmission Capacity
Regulations in the electricity market continue to impose barriers to competition and greater efficiency. Today’s regulatory structure may not encourage
regulators in one jurisdiction to take into account the full effects of their
actions on the rest of the transmission grid because the regulatory system is
based on an industry structure that no longer exists. For example, the transmission grid crosses state boundaries, so what happens in one state affects the
residents of other states. However, state regulators might not consider the
costs and benefits of their actions on citizens of other states. As a result, regulation of the transmission grid has not kept up with changes in the market.
Extensive blackouts in the Northeast and Midwest in August 2003 and in
the West in August 1996 demonstrated the potential costs of not updating and
coordinating Federal, state, and local regulations. Despite the growing
demand for electricity and the growing demand for transmission capacity to
satisfy the wholesale market, construction of new transmission facilities has
declined by about 30 percent since 1990. The current mix of regulations has
facilitated increased use of transmission capacity, but has not done enough to
encourage companies to invest in building new capacity. For example, some
state and local regulations have discouraged the construction of new local facilities, thus encouraging increased transmission from more distant locations.
State deregulation may also give local utilities the incentive to import
lower cost electricity from generators in other states. The growth of interstate transmission of electricity has increased the need for Federal, state, and
local governments to coordinate their regulations that affect the interstate
transmission grid.
Another problem with existing regulation is that state and Federal regulators approve transmission rates to provide the owners of transmission lines a
fixed rate of return, but the chosen rate may not be high enough to
encourage firms to invest in sufficient new transmission capacity. One factor
that is not fully considered in rate-of-return calculations is the lengthy and
uncertain permitting process that requires companies to deal with multiple
regulators. Because these costs are not fully accounted for, the effective rate
Chapter 8

| 163

of return often is too low to attract investment. Such regulatory uncertainties are just one of many factors that make investing in new transmission
capacity risky. Higher rates of return may be needed to spur investment.
Insufficient investment in new transmission capacity is not the only
problem stemming from improper regulation of rates of return. Such regulation may also prevent investment from being channeled to areas that most
need new transmission capacity. Higher prices for use of the most congested
parts of the grid would reduce transmission over these parts of the grid and
send a signal to potential investors to expand capacity in those areas. Grid
operators in some parts of the country now use locational marginal pricing
to set prices in different locations based on both the cost of generation and
the cost of congestion. Areas that are served by congested transmission lines
pay higher prices reflecting the cost of such congestion.
Congestion in the transmission grid leads to both lower reliability and less
competition. The lack of competition results from the low-cost generators’
inability to send power to high-cost areas, forcing the high-cost areas to use
less efficient, locally-produced electricity. Adding new transmission capacity
between low-cost and high-cost areas could increase prices in low-cost areas
in the short run. However, these price increases would likely lead to new
generating capacity being built in low-cost areas, reducing prices back
toward existing levels.

Regulations That Require Updating
As electricity markets have become more competitive, Federal regulations
designed to prevent utilities from abusing their government-granted
monopoly power may have ceased to serve the public interest. For example,
the Public Utilities Holding Company Act (PUHCA) was originally passed
in the 1930s to limit the size and type of operations in which a public utility
may engage, including the types of companies that can own utilities. Today,
these limits may actually increase prices to consumers by preventing utilities
from engaging in activities that could make their businesses more efficient.
These limits also may prevent public utilities from expanding their operations in ways that would increase competition in other parts of the country.
The evolution of the electric power industry from a natural monopoly to
an increasingly competitive market calls for regulations that facilitate rather
than hinder efficiency and innovation. The Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) is working on new regulations for wholesale electricity
markets with the goal of having market forces encourage the lowest-cost
generators to provide electricity.

164 | Economic Report of the President

Demand Response to Electricity Production Costs
Many residential electric rates today are fixed throughout the day at a level
based on the average cost of generating and delivering electricity to the residential customer. The cost of producing electricity, however, is not fixed
throughout the day. Instead, electricity generators constantly adjust production to meet demand hour by hour or even minute by minute. As a result,
the marginal cost of electricity production—the cost to produce one extra
unit of electricity—varies widely over the course of a day. Wholesale prices
reflect this, with lower prices in the middle of the night (a period of low
demand) and higher prices in late afternoon (a period of peak demand).
Under the current regulatory structure, however, many consumers are
charged the same rate regardless of the wholesale cost of electricity so that
utilities cannot raise prices to reflect the true cost of generation. As a result,
local regulated utilities must have access to enough generating capacity to
meet peak demand, as well as enough transmission and distribution capacity
to get the electricity to all customers. Chart 8-2 illustrates the fluctuations in
electricity consumption and wholesale prices over a week in August 1999.
During the week illustrated, the regulated utilities were at times forced to sell
electricity at a loss because wholesale prices rose above the fixed retail rate.
It is not cost-effective to store large quantities of electricity. Therefore, the
requirement that electric utilities meet all demand at fixed retail prices

Chapter 8

| 165

means that they must build enough capacity to meet the highest peak
demand during the year. They also need to maintain reserve capacity to
offset any supply lost due to generation or transmission problems. Some of
this capacity is only required during the relatively few hours of the year when
demand peaks, for example, on the hottest days in August.
Without the ability to increase retail prices during peak demand to
encourage consumers to cut their energy consumption, insufficient generation capacity would lead to a rationing of supply, for example, rolling
blackouts. While some electric utilities offer time-of-day pricing, a system in
which retail rates are higher during periods of peak demand, these prices do
not vary with the actual cost of generating electricity on a particular day.
These programs reduce the average peak demand but do not provide the
needed incentives to cut power usage on days with extreme peak demand.
Some consumers also receive lower rates in exchange for allowing the electric
company to interrupt their service if wholesale costs increase above a certain
level. There are some programs that allow the utility to cut off all of a
consumer’s power, while others simply allow the utility to turn off the
consumer’s air-conditioning. There are also typically limits on how long or how
many times the utility can cut off power. These programs to reduce peak electricity usage thus represent only a partial implementation of variable pricing.
A reduction in peak demand achieved through variable pricing would
allow regulated utilities to build less generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure. Because they cannot increase retail prices, these utilities
use other means to reduce peak demand, such as rebates to consumers who
purchase energy-efficient appliances or incentives to improve weatherization
of homes. While these programs reduce peak demand by increasing energy
efficiency, they do not use the market to determine which ways of cutting
electricity demand would have the lowest cost. Furthermore, as electricity
markets evolve, there may no longer be one firm that can capture all of the
benefits from reducing peak demand. As a result, these programs may not
be able to continue because individual companies have less incentive to
implement them.
Current programs that attempt to reduce peak demand still leave customers
unaffected by changes in the cost of production until shortages and interruptions in service result. If retail prices were allowed to increase, consumers could
decide to cut their consumption (possibly to zero). This approach could
improve overall welfare by reducing the number of peaking plants needed; that
is, it may be less costly to curtail demand than to add to supply by building
expensive generation capacity that is rarely used. However, for variable pricing
to be completely implemented, new meters and smart appliances may be
needed so that consumers can acquire the information and technology needed
to adjust their usage as electricity prices change.

Energy and Trade
The United States benefits greatly from global trade in energy markets.
Gasoline and diesel fuels refined from crude oil are currently the most
widely used transportation fuels. By importing petroleum, U.S. firms are
able to continue to supply gasoline and diesel at real prices comparable to
historical averages, even as environmental regulations have increased the
costs of refining. Adjusted for inflation, gasoline prices are much lower than
at their peak in 1981. However, this beneficial trade requires reliance on
imports that could be subject to supply disruptions.
Because crude oil is traded throughout the world, its price is affected by
global changes in supply and demand. Disruptions to the supply of oil from
areas that do not supply the United States would affect domestic prices of
oil even if U.S. imports are not directly affected. Indeed, domestic prices of
oil would be affected even if the United States produced all of its oil domestically (unless petroleum exports were prohibited). The outcome is the same
because the price of oil is set in global markets.
Meeting all U.S. energy needs from domestic sources would require
significant changes to the U.S. economy, including changes in the types of
transportation fuels used by Americans. The costs of these changes would
probably exceed the costs resulting from periodic unexpected increases in
the global price of oil. This is suggested by the fact that prior oil market
disruptions did not lead to such structural changes in the U.S. economy.
Moreover, oil markets have undergone tremendous changes since the 1970s
that likely reduce the risks to the U.S. economy from a disruption in crude
oil production and imports.

U.S. Energy Sources
Most energy consumed in the United States is produced in North
America. In 2002, the main energy sources were petroleum (39 percent),
natural gas (24 percent), coal (23 percent), and nuclear power (8 percent).
In 2002, roughly 80 percent of U.S. energy needs were met by North
American sources, including 59 percent of crude oil, 99 percent of natural
gas, 100 percent of coal, and roughly 45 percent of uranium for nuclear
power generation. Petroleum is the main energy source that the United
States imports in significant amounts from outside North America. Hence,
discussions of energy security focus on imports of crude oil. In the future,
analysts expect the United States to import more natural gas, but there are
many potential suppliers.
The United States also imports a large share of uranium from outside North
America, but there are sufficient North American reserves of uranium that

Chapter 8

| 167

could be used if less-expensive foreign sources were not available. Furthermore,
uranium fuel represents a relatively small portion of the cost of nuclear electricity generation. Also, most uranium is produced in stable parts of the world,
with Canada and Australia producing about half of the world’s total.

Changes in the Oil Market
A disruption in crude oil production in an area that does not supply the
United States would still affect the United States by raising oil prices in the
worldwide market. However, the power of the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), or of any one country, to affect world oil
prices is less today than it was in the past. OPEC’s influence on the market
has fallen with the decline of its market share from 55 percent in 1973 to 39
percent in 2002. Other evidence of the diversification of sources of crude oil
is that in 1973, the top eight producing countries produced 75 percent of the
world’s oil, while in 2002 the top eight producing countries produced only
54 percent. Access to a greater number of sources of oil reduces the impact of
a disruption in any one region on the world oil price. In addition, the
increased sophistication of financial markets for oil and related products has
made it easier to hedge oil price risks. With financial instruments such as
futures contracts, firms are better able to avoid having potential disruptions
in the crude oil market lead to substantial immediate cost increases from their
energy inputs.
Another significant difference between today and the 1970s is that the
United States no longer has price controls on gasoline and oil. During the
oil shocks of the 1970s, Federal government mandates kept consumer prices
artificially low and dampened the amount of gasoline conservation that
otherwise would have occurred in response to increased prices. As a result,
people wanted to consume more gasoline than suppliers were willing to
supply at the artificially low price leading to shortages in the United States.
When prices are not regulated, large swings in oil prices do not disrupt the
economy nearly as much. For example, between June 15, 1998, and
November 27, 2000, the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil
more than tripled from $11.69 to $36.24 per barrel without throwing the
economy into disarray. These price increases did not cause major economic
disruptions for two main reasons. First, energy consumption per 1996 dollar
of real GDP has dropped 43 percent, from 18,360 British thermal units
(BTU—a measure of the energy content in fuels) per dollar in 1973 to
10,450 BTU per dollar in 2001. Second, market signals have worked to
increase the flexibility of U.S. energy markets, allowing them to adjust and
adapt to market changes. This is why market forces work better to allocate
goods than command-and-control measures such as price controls.

168 | Economic Report of the President

Another change from the 1970s has been the expansion of the strategic
reserve of crude oil that can be used during severe disruptions to the oil
market. Created in 1975, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve held 634.7 million
barrels as of December 2003—enough oil to replace U.S. crude oil imports
from the Persian Gulf for approximately 287 days. While maintaining the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve entails storage and inventory costs, holding
reserves to increase energy security is less likely to distort the market than
other measures, such as attempting to replace U.S. oil imports with more
expensive sources of energy.

Trade in Oil and Price Stability
In considering whether it is worth taking steps to decrease U.S. reliance
on petroleum imports from outside North America, it is useful to compare
the movement of oil prices with the prices of other commodities in which
the United States is self-sufficient. It turns out that having a supply of a
commodity in the United States or North America is not an assurance of
stable prices. Numerous factors affect both the supply and the demand of
goods so that commodities such as natural gas, wholesale electricity, and
many agricultural goods also exhibit price volatility even when supplied
wholly from North American sources.
Relying on imported oil reduces the United States’ overall expenditures on
energy. Without crude oil imports, the cost of gasoline and other petroleum
products (or alternative transportation fuels) would be higher. Therefore, the
United States would have to devote a greater portion of its resources to
paying for the costs of energy, especially for transportation, than is the case
today. Without petroleum imports, it would be necessary to use significantly
less gasoline and more transportation fuels made from corn, soybeans, or
other agricultural products, or liquid fuels from coal, natural gas, oil sands,
or oil shale. Under current technologies, these substitutes all cost substantially more to produce than gasoline from crude oil.

The Evolution of Energy Markets
Energy sources have changed as society’s needs have evolved over time.
Wood was replaced by coal, which was replaced by petroleum. Eventually,
the energy market may evolve to include substantial energy production from
new sources, such as renewable energy, hydrogen, or nuclear fusion.
Government policy can help move this evolutionary process forward by
encouraging research in new energy technologies. However, forcing the transition to new technologies before the market signals that old technologies
should begin to be phased out could involve tremendous costs to society.
Chapter 8

| 169

Market signals have already altered U.S. energy consumption. In response
to higher crude oil prices, U.S. crude consumption fell by 21 percent
between 1978 and 1983 even as real GDP grew by 7.8 percent. Demand
shifted towards coal, which experienced the smallest price increase of any
major fuel, and away from oil and natural gas, which experienced the greatest
increases. Even with the increased consumption of coal, total U.S. energy
consumption declined 1.8 percent annually between 1978 and 1983. This
decrease occurred despite the longer-term upward trend of energy consumption, which averaged 1.1 percent annually between 1971 and 2001. Energy
conservation programs and other nonmarket forces may have been responsible for some of the reduced demand for energy. However, at least 80 percent
(and probably more) of the demand reduction can be attributed to higher
prices and overall changes in the economy.
Market signals have also triggered a great deal of innovation to lower the
cost of finding and extracting oil. For example, three-dimensional seismic
technologies have lowered the cost of finding oil, and directional drilling has
lowered the cost of extracting oil so that reserves that were not viable in the
past can be extracted profitably today. Similarly, technological advances have
lowered the cost of extracting oil from oil sands so that production from oil
sands is competitive at today’s oil prices. As a result, at least one industry
publication has classified a portion of Canada’s large oil sand deposits as
proved oil reserves; estimates of Canada’s proved oil reserves are now second
only to those of Saudi Arabia.
The technology exists to convert large North American reserves of oil
sands, oil shale, natural gas, coal, wood, and agricultural products into
liquid fuels such as gasoline, diesel, methanol, and ethanol. Some of these
processes are now prohibitively expensive, but these fuels could compete
with fuels produced from crude oil if oil prices increased or if research and
development lowered their production costs. Chart 8-3 illustrates the range
of estimated costs of producing synthetic fuels that could compete with oil
in the market for liquid fuels. For example, at a price for oil of $20 a barrel,
liquid fuels from oil sands and natural gas may be able to cover production
costs, while oil shale, coal, ethanol, and biodiesel would not be viable
sources. Higher prices could eventually make these alternatives commercially viable. Note that the extraction process for some of these fuels may
have adverse environmental consequences that could limit their use and that
some of these processes yield low-sulfur fuels that may burn more cleanly
than fuels produced from crude oil. The chart does not consider either the
costs of the externalities or the benefits of the cleaner fuels.
There is a role for government in subsidizing research and development
into new energy sources. For example, hydrogen shows strong potential as a
possible future fuel, though many technological hurdles must be overcome
170 | Economic Report of the President

before it becomes practical for everyday use. Even if hydrogen became a
feasible energy source, there would be still more problems to be resolved
before the technology became economically competitive. Government
subsidies for research and development may aid the private market in developing technology to produce, transport, and use hydrogen economically as
a fuel. However, market forces should decide when commercial adoption of
hydrogen as an energy source will be competitive.
Policy makers should avoid forcing commercialization of new energy
sources before market signals indicate that a shift is required. One potential
problem with forcing this process is that technological breakthroughs may
lead to alternatives that are not seriously considered today. Premature adoption of new technologies would raise energy costs before the need arises,
causing society as a whole to spend more on energy than needed, a misallocation of resources that would hurt the U.S. economy. For example, forcing
adoption of energy sources other than oil to gain complete energy independence would be prohibitively expensive; it would require tremendous
reductions in the use of energy derived from crude oil through the use of
alternative energy sources that are far from competitive.

Chapter 8

Conclusion
Regulations can improve the performance of energy markets by
addressing market failures such as externalities and market power. However,
it is essential to design regulations to address these potential market failures
without reducing the benefits from markets. An added complication occurs
when the goals of local and Federal regulators conflict. Regulators should
adjust the rules as markets evolve and ensure that the regulations’ goals are
achieved. Finally, regulators should be careful not to adopt regulations that
cause more harm than the potential market failure.

Protecting the Environment

E

conomic growth and environmental improvements go hand-in-hand.
Economic growth can lead to increased demand for environmental
improvements and can provide the resources that make it possible to address
environmental problems. Some policies aimed at promoting environmental
improvements can entail substantial economic costs. Misguided policies might
actually achieve less environmental progress than alternative policies for the
same economic cost. It is therefore important to weigh the direct benefits of
environmental regulations against their economic costs.
While the free-market system typically promotes efficiency and thus
enhances economic growth, the absence of property rights for environmental
“goods” such as clean air and water can lead to negative externalities that reduce
societal well-being. This can be addressed by establishing and enforcing property rights that will lead the affected parties to negotiate mutually-beneficial
outcomes in a market setting. If such negotiations are expensive, however, the
government can design regulations that consider both the benefits of reducing
the environmental externality as well as the costs the regulations impose on
society. Regulations should be designed to achieve environmental goals at the
lowest cost possible, thus helping to achieve environmental protection and
continued economic growth.
The key points in this chapter are:
• Establishing and enforcing property rights for the environment can
address environmentally-related market failures. Any needed regulations
should consider both the benefits and the costs.
• Environmental risks should be evaluated using sound scientific methods
to avoid possible distortions of regulatory priorities.
• Market-based regulations, such as the cap-and-trade programs promoted by
the Administration to reduce common air pollutants, can achieve environmental goals at lower cost than inflexible command-and-control regulations.

The Free Market and the Environment
In a free-market system, only trades that benefit both parties will take place.
Market prices coordinate the activities of buyers and sellers and convey information about the strength of consumer demand for a good, as well as how
costly it is to supply. In the context of the environment, a market failure may
173

occur if a voluntary transaction between parties imposes involuntary costs
on a third party. These involuntary third-party costs are known as negative
externalities (or spillovers), and their existence in a free market can lead to
inefficient outcomes; that is, outcomes that fail to maximize the net benefits
to society. For example, a plant might produce and sell a good to a consumer
to both their advantage, but the production process may result in emissions
of air pollutants that negatively affect others not involved in the transaction.
The root of the market failure is that there are no clear property rights for
the surrounding air. The interests of the third party—the people affected by
the plant’s emissions—are not represented in the market transaction.
If those affected by the plant’s emissions had a right to demand compensation
for the costs imposed on them by the pollution, then the firm would take
these costs into account when making its production decisions. The plant
would produce only up to the point where the benefit of another unit of
production equals the additional cost of producing the good plus the cost to
the people negatively affected by the pollution. Any additional emissions due
to producing more goods would require compensation that is greater than the
monetary gain the plant gets from selling the additional goods. Likewise, if the
property right belonged to the plant, the people negatively affected by the
emissions could compensate the plant for reduced emissions. Either way, all
three parties (consumers, the firm, and those affected by the emissions) would
transact voluntarily to everyone’s benefit, resulting in an efficient outcome. If
the government were to assign and enforce the property right, and if it were
costless for parties to collectively agree on compensation, then an efficient use
of resources would result from private bargaining, regardless of which party
was assigned the property right. This insight is known as the Coase theorem.

The Role of Government in
Regulating the Environment
The existence of property rights does not always guarantee an efficient
outcome. If there are many sources of pollution or there are many parties
affected by the emissions, then it might be difficult for the parties collectively
to agree on the compensation, and an efficient outcome might therefore not
be achieved. This presents an economic justification for government involvement and regulation. Government regulation might also be justified in order
to address distributional concerns associated with environmental problems.
Regulations that address negative externalities can therefore improve
societal welfare. To improve the environment while still promoting economic
growth, sound policies must consider both the benefits and the costs of regulations. Economic growth itself can contribute to environmental improvements
174 | Economic Report of the President

(Box 9-1). As the economy grows, the demand for environmental
improvements increases and the greater wealth provides more resources to
better address environmental concerns. It is therefore important to weigh the
direct environmental benefits of regulations against their economic costs.

Box 9-1: Economic Growth Can Improve the Environment
Much research has shown that economic growth contributes to
environmental gains. In the early stages of economic development, environmental degradation may occur because nations place higher priority
on basic needs such as food and shelter. As wealth increases, however,
so does demand for a cleaner environment, and greater wealth provides
more resources to better address these environmental concerns. After a
certain level of national income is attained, the balance shifts and environmental degradation is arrested and then reversed. For several
decades in the United States, many environmental indicators have been
improving as the economy has also grown.
From 1975 to 2002, concentrations of five of the six common air
pollutants (the pollutants for which there are reliable data) decreased
by an average of 60 percent (Chart 9-1), as real gross domestic
product (GDP) increased by about 130 percent, energy consumption
increased by 35 percent, and the population increased by 34 percent.
While the Nation’s air quality has improved substantially since
passage of the Clean Air Act of 1970, air quality was improving prior
to 1970, perhaps due to market-induced technological advancements
(such as improvements in energy efficiency) that accompany
economic growth. The limited air-quality monitoring data available
before 1970 indicate that average annual concentrations of particulate
matter in urban air dropped 16 percent from 1957 to 1970 and these
total suspended particulates (liquid or solid particles in the air) across
the country fell by about six percent from 1958 to 1970 (Chart 9-2).
As the Nation’s productive output has increased and environmental
quality has improved, so too has the health and well-being of
Americans. In the last century, life expectancy at birth increased from
48 to 80 years for women and from 46 to 74 years for men. Infant
mortality dropped to the lowest level ever recorded in the United
States. The death rates for heart disease, cancer, and stroke are also
decreasing. This well-documented correlation between wealth and
health extends across time and nations. More-developed countries
have higher life expectancy, and globally, life expectancy has
increased as per capita wealth has increased.

176 | Economic Report of the President

Misplaced Reasons for Government Intervention
In making environmental policies, it must be recognized that government
measures themselves might create further inefficiencies. When it is difficult
to determine the extent of an environmental externality, an attempt to
rectify it might end up making matters worse by imposing unintended costs
on third parties without achieving an efficient outcome.
This inefficiency can arise even from well-intentioned environmental
regulations. Two fallacious arguments are frequently used to justify inefficient regulations. One such misplaced rationale is that regulations improve
the economy and spur job growth. The reasoning goes as follows: environmental regulations lead firms to install pollution-control technologies,
which they must purchase from other firms. These technologies are built,
delivered, installed, and operated by workers who otherwise would not be
doing this work. Similarly, the regulations may promote environmentallyfriendly industries that hire people who would not be hired otherwise. For
these reasons, the regulations are said to “spur” the economy and job growth.
By this reasoning, throwing a rock through a window also improves the
economy, because it necessitates the hiring of someone to repair the window.
What this ignores is that the resources spent to comply with an unnecessary
or inefficient regulation are diverted from other uses. The money and people
involved could have been used instead to produce more goods for consumers
or to build new factories or machinery. The jobs associated with complying
with environmental regulations are a cost of regulation, not a benefit.
Another misplaced view of environmental regulation is that the goal of
regulations should be to eliminate or substantially reduce risks without
considering costs. This approach is embodied in some well-intentioned laws.
The 1970 Clean Air Act, for example, directs the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) Administrator to set national ambient air quality standards
(NAAQS) that achieve “an adequate margin of safety,” and the Supreme
Court has ruled that “the Clean Air Act…unambiguously bars cost considerations in the NAAQS setting process.” Similarly, the stated goal of the
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 is “to assure so far as possible
every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working
conditions,” without considering the costs of doing so. While the goals of
these laws are noble, they do not recognize the inevitable trade-offs involved.
Not all environmental laws preclude cost considerations. For example, the
Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 explicitly acknowledge the
importance of benefit-cost analysis when considering the appropriate level
of regulation for contaminants in drinking water.

Chapter 9

| 177

Regulations Impose Benefits and Costs
The failure to consider costs inhibits the goal of making regulations that
maximize the difference between benefits and costs. Furthermore, the failure
to consider costs can lead to a misallocation of resources, because a regulation
that is made without considering costs might receive more resources than
other regulations that warrant greater attention. While the benefits of many
regulations include both health and non-health related benefits, many regulations primarily address fatality risks, and there is a wide range of cost per
expected life saved across such regulations. For example, one survey of cost per
life saved across regulations found that the regulation for childproof cigarette
lighters costs approximately $100,000 per life saved (in 2003 dollars) whereas
the formaldehyde regulation costs approximately $80 billion per life saved (in
2003 dollars). Shifting resources from regulations where the cost per expected
life saved is high (for example, formaldehyde regulation) to regulations where
it is low (for example, childproof lighter regulation) would result in more lives
saved for the same cost to society. Many of the differences in cost per life saved
occur because legislative mandates only sometimes allow agencies to consider
costs when crafting regulations.
Stringent regulations may appear to be good for society because they save
lives. However, because the Nation’s ability to bear costs is limited, the wide
range of costs per life saved across regulations implies that more lives could
be saved at the same cost by shifting resources to the regulations with lower
costs per expected life saved. One study found that society could save twice
as many lives with the same budget if it designed regulations in a way that
maximized lives saved. Some of the more costly health-based regulations
might actually lead to a net increase in fatality risk because their high
costs diminish the resources available for improving other health and
environmental outcomes.

Using Science to Help Set Regulatory Priorities
Sound regulatory policy must be based on scientific assessments of
environmental and health risks. Scientific assessments involve a careful
examination of the risks involved and of the expected health outcomes for
the people exposed to the risk at hand. This allows for an unbiased evaluation of environmental and health threats in which to target regulatory
actions. Unfortunately, regulatory risk assessments at times overestimate
some threats, or overemphasize risks to “hypothetical” (rather than real)
people. These practices can lead to a distortion of regulatory priorities.

178 | Economic Report of the President

Overestimating the Risks: The Problem with
“Cascading Conservatism”
In a well-intentioned attempt to be prudent, regulatory agencies sometimes
rely on scientific assessments of environmental and health risks based on
assumptions that overstate actual risks. When estimating chemical toxicity, for
example, risk assessors have at times relied on high-end default assumptions
that are likely to overestimate the actual risk of a chemical. Toxicity testing is
evolving to use information that permits assessors to move away from assumptions that lead to overstated risks. When more data are available, regulatory
risk assessors do not need to rely on high-end default assumptions and can
instead attempt to estimate more accurately the expected level of risk. Because
the EPA’s primary goal is public health protection, however, it still relies on
high-end default assumptions when there is uncertainty about scientific data.
Similarly, regulatory agencies sometimes use high-end estimates of the
likelihood of people being exposed to a certain risk. These exposure estimates are then combined with toxicity estimates that are themselves likely to
overstate risk. The multiplicative impact of combining several high-end
component estimates is known as cascading conservatism. This practice can
lead to risk estimates that greatly overstate the threat of environmental problems and thus overstate the benefits of regulating those risks. One study
found that in a sample of hazardous waste sites, over 40 percent of the sites
requiring cleanup under the Superfund program would shift into the discretionary cleanup range if not for the overestimation of risks resulting from
cascading conservatism.
Such high-end risk estimates can lead to several types of problems. First,
the practice overstates the risk of all environmental health problems relative
to other types of hazards. This overstatement can cause too many resources
to be allocated to addressing low-priority concerns. An example of such a
distortion is the commonly-held view that synthetic chemical pollutants
such as insecticides are a leading contributor to cancer. In reality, the
evidence suggests that such chemicals account for a low percentage of
human cancers. The main contributors to human cancer appear to be
smoking and poor diet—each of which accounts for about one-third of
cancers. The result is that regulatory efforts are directed at addressing the
risks of synthetic chemicals that may well pose lower risks of causing cancer
than many common natural chemicals.
A second problem with the high-end risk estimates caused by cascading
conservatism is that they can distort the allocation of resources among
different environmental health concerns. If each uncertain component that
goes into a risk assessment overstates the risk, then the multiplicative impact
of cascading conservatism will result in higher risk estimates for threats that
have more uncertain components. For example, if there are two equally
Chapter 9

| 179

effective pesticides, with one posing a higher threat to the population than
the other, the safer pesticide might be assessed as more of a threat if there are
more uncertain components involved in its risk assessment. This assessment
could result in the safer pesticide receiving stronger regulatory emphasis by
the government. It is better to target regulatory dollars to the risks expected
to be higher in a reasonable scenario or range of scenarios than to the risks
that might be higher in a worst-case scenario.

Population-Weighted Risk Assessments
Regulatory efforts can also be distorted when risk assessments ignore the
number of real people potentially exposed to an environmental risk. For
example, an environmental hazard at one location might pose a greater risk
to any person exposed to the hazard than an environmental hazard at a
second location. However, if no one lives near the first location and many
people live near the second location, the expected risk to society is higher at
the second location.
The case of United States v. Ottati & Goss offers one example of such
misplaced regulatory priorities. In this case, a company litigated for relief of
an EPA-required cleanup that would have cost the company $9.3 million to
remove small amounts of contaminants from a site that was already mostly
decontaminated. The company had already spent $2.6 million to clean the
site so that small children playing on the site could eat small amounts of dirt
daily for 70 days each year for three and a half years without significant
harm. The additional $9.3 million would be used to burn the soil, which
would allow children to eat a small amount of dirt each day for 245 days per
year without significant harm. However, there was little chance that children
would ever be exposed to this site because it was located in a swamp. The
courts ruled in favor of the private party and refused to enforce the proposed
remediation goal.

Objective Versus Perceived Risk
Regulatory decisions should be based on scientific assessments of risks
rather than perceived risks. This approach would help properly order priorities for regulatory decisions. Perceived risks often differ from expert
assessments of risk because laypeople have difficulty assessing the frequency
of low-probability events. Chart 9-3 compares survey respondents’ perceived
risks of dying from various hazards to the objectively measured risks of dying.
In this chart, the dashed line represents where the perceived risk equals the
actual risk; if all the points on the chart fell on this line, it would indicate that
survey participants precisely estimated the risk of dying from various hazards.
All points to the left of the dashed line represent hazards for which the
180 | Economic Report of the President

perceived risk of dying is higher than the actual risk, and all points to the
right of the line indicate hazards for which people thought the risk of dying
is lower than it actually is. The chart suggests that it is common to overestimate fatalities associated with low-probability events and to underestimate
fatalities associated with high-probability events. These systematic misperceptions may lead to misplaced pressures to overregulate small environmental
risks at the expense of addressing larger ones.

Achieving Goals Through
Cost-Effective Regulations
As discussed in Chapter 7, Government Regulation in a Free-Market
Society, when the assignment of property rights is insufficient to achieve an
efficient outcome, government intervention may help achieve efficiency.
Chapter 7 discusses government actions that can, in principle, achieve an
efficient outcome by incorporating the costs of externalities into the market’s
price mechanism. It is important that any regulatory mechanism that
addresses externalities do so in the least costly (that is, the most costeffective) way so that society’s scarce resources are not wasted. This section
focuses on how to achieve air-quality goals cost effectively, but many of the
Chapter 9

| 181

lessons can be applied toward achieving other environmental goals, such as
clean water protection and energy-efficiency standards.

Command-and-Control Regulations
Air-quality command-and-control regulations prescribe specific technologies
that individual firms must use to control emissions, or they set specific emission rates for individual firms. The United States currently has many such
environmental regulations. These regulations are inherently inflexible and are
ill-suited to achieving emissions reductions in the least costly manner. While
some command-and-control air-quality regulations may be just slightly more
costly than cost-effective regulations, studies show that others are up to
22 times more expensive than the most cost-effective set of controls.
The reason command-and-control regulations are more expensive is
straightforward: suppose the regulatory goal is to halve the emissions
emanating from two firms. A command-and-control regulation might
require each firm to cut its emissions by half. However, if it is less costly for
one firm to reduce emissions, then—so long as the health effects of the emissions depend only on the total from the two emission sources—shifting the
burden to the firm with lower abatement costs would result in the same environmental improvement at a lower cost. In general, the greater the differences
across firms in their emissions before the regulation, and the greater the
differences across firms in the rate at which each firm’s costs rise with additional reductions, then the more costly a command-and-control approach is
compared to more flexible approaches. Cost-effective emissions reduction is
achieved when the cost of reducing an additional unit of emissions (the
marginal abatement cost) is equal across all firms.
An example of an inflexible command-and-control regulation is the
mechanism by which the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 address
hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). The Act specifies that the emissions reduction standards for categories of existing HAP polluters must be set at “the
average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of
the existing sources.” While some flexibility is allowed in establishing the
emission limitations, the command-and-control standard for regulating
HAPs has frequently been interpreted in a way that ignores the differential
costs of reducing emissions across existing sources within a category. This
likely results in higher costs than would a more flexible regulation.
Command-and-control regulations also fail to provide market incentives
for firms to explore less expensive means of reducing emissions. More flexible, incentive-based regulations would provide signals to the market of the
increased demand for emissions reductions. With proper incentives in place,
markets can respond to such an increase in demand with technological innovation and efficient reallocation of their scarce resources to achieve the goal.
182 | Economic Report of the President

Command-and-control regulations can also unintentionally lead to
outcomes that are contrary to their environmental goals. An example of this is
the New Source Review component of the 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments.
This legislation required a strict control technology for most new industrial
facilities and for facilities that undertook significant modifications, but it
exempted existing facilities that did not make major modifications from the
same standards. It was thought at the time to be more efficient to add new
pollution control technology when plants were upgrading or when building
new plants. This situation is known as new source bias because it provides an
incentive for existing sources of emissions to continue their business operations for longer than would have been the case under normal market
conditions without the regulation. It also provides an incentive for existing
plants to forgo modifications.
New pollution-causing production sources tend to be cleaner than old ones
even in the absence of regulations, so extending the business operations of
older plants without making modifications could result in higher emissions.
Applying different regulations for “routine” versus “major” modifications also
leads to ambiguity, litigation delays, and uncertainty in business planning, all
of which can harm the economy and may impede environmental improvements. The Administration recently addressed this problem by establishing
clear rules that remove disincentives for facilities to modify and undertake
routine maintenance, repair, and replacement activities that could improve
the safety, reliability, and efficiency of the plants.

Market-Based Price Regulations: Emission Fees
Environmental regulations that provide firms with market-based incentives
for emissions reduction avoid the complications of command-and-control
regulations and achieve the same goals at lower costs. In particular, emission
fees and cap-and-trade programs are usually less expensive than commandand-control approaches at achieving regulatory goals. An emission fee
involves a charge to polluting sources for each unit of pollution emitted.
Because each successive unit of emissions reduction typically involves
increased costs, each source will reduce emissions until it would cost more to
reduce the next unit of emissions than it would to pay the emissions fee. This
results in equal marginal abatement costs across all affected firms.
With an emission fee, the total level of emissions reduction will depend on
the per unit fee: a higher rate will achieve more emissions reduction. The
emission fee also provides incentives to reduce emissions, because the better
a firm is at reducing emissions, the lower the total fee the firm must pay. This
sends a market signal that pollution has a price (equal to the emission fee),
and any innovative means of reducing emissions will save firms from paying
the fee. This market signal is likely more adept than the government at
Chapter 9

| 183

spurring technological innovation, adapting to changes in the economy, and
shifting resources to reflect the increased demand for emissions reduction.

Market-Based Quantity Regulations: Cap-and-Trade
The main problem with an emission fee is that it is difficult to know
beforehand what fee level will achieve the desired amount of pollution
reduction. A cap-and-trade regulation addresses this issue and provides
market incentives to reduce emissions in a cost-effective way. Such regulations “cap” the amount of allowable emissions and require that a firm own
a permit for each unit of pollution emitted in a given period (for example,
a year). This permit effectively establishes a legal property right for the air
affected by the pollution, so that any emissions must be paid for by the firm.
The government allocates the pollution permits to the emission sources and
then allows the sources to buy and sell permits from each other.
Under a cap-and-trade system, a source with a high cost of reducing an
additional unit of emissions would be willing to purchase a permit from a
source with a lower marginal abatement cost. With a well-functioning
market for the permits, sources will trade permits until the price for the
permits equals the marginal abatement cost. As with the emission fee, the
marginal abatement costs will be equal across sources, leading to a cost-effective result. The cap-and-trade system also provides an incentive to reduce
emissions because each unit of emissions reduction saves the source the price
of another permit. This regulation sends a market signal that there is a price
for emissions and any innovative means of reducing emissions will save firms
from paying the price. The cap-and-trade system therefore achieves the
target level of pollution reduction at the lowest cost.
One consideration for a cap-and-trade system is how to allocate the
permits initially. A cap-and-trade system that allocates the permits based on
historic emissions or other firm characteristics, known as grandfathering, in
essence gives away a valuable asset—the permits. A grandfathering system
could establish a barrier to entry for new firms because any new entrant
would have to purchase permits from existing firms.
One way to avoid these problems is to auction the permits at some regular
interval to the highest bidders. Firms with higher marginal abatement costs
would bid more for permits than those that can achieve less-costly emissions
reductions. While auctioning the permits would result in lower profits for
the regulated firms (compared to giving away the permits), it would not
affect the firms’ output decisions. Grandfathering versus auctioning the
permits is primarily a question of distribution, not efficiency—it is a
question of whether a public asset should be given to firms for free or sold
as a means of generating public revenues.

184 | Economic Report of the President

A notable example of a cap-and-trade system is the sulfur dioxide (SO2)
trading program created under Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990. The program set a goal of reducing emissions by 10 million tons
from the 1980 level by 2010. This was to be accomplished in two phases.
The first phase, which began in 1995, initially capped the SO2 emissions at
263 individual units which were owned by 110 electric utility power plants
in 21 eastern and midwestern states. These plants, which were primarily
coal-fired, emitted the greatest amounts of pollution among power plants in
these regions. From 1995 to 2000, an additional 182 units were allowed into
the program. The second phase, which began in 2000, further decreased the
annual emissions of SO2 and required all large fossil fuel-fired power plants
in the contiguous 48 states and the District of Columbia to hold permits to
cover their emissions.
In both phases, power plants could purchase permits from other power
plants in order to meet their emissions coverage. The program also allowed
plants to carry over (or bank) unused permits to use in later years, which
gives firms even greater flexibility in achieving long-term pollution reduction. In contrast to a command-and-control system, this cap-and-trade
system allows plants that find it costly to reduce their SO2 emissions to
purchase credits from plants that can reduce SO2 at lower cost.
Evidence indicates that such cost-saving trades did indeed take place as
firms took advantage of the system’s inherent flexibility (Chart 9-4). Each
bar in the following chart represents the emissions rate each plant achieved
after trading permits in 1997. The superimposed line in the figure shows the
level of emissions each plant would have had to achieve in the absence of
trading. Bars below the line indicate plants that reduced their emissions by
more than the required amount and sold their excess permits or banked
them. Bars above the line indicate plants that purchased permits or used
previously banked permits to avoid costly abatement. The figure shows that
almost every plant took advantage of the flexibility of the system, suggesting
that plant-level costs of reducing SO2 emissions vary greatly.
The trading program has achieved its pollution-reduction goals at great
cost savings. By the end of the first phase, emission reductions were almost
30 percent below the required level. The flexibility of this approach has been
estimated to provide cost savings of approximately $0.9 billion to $1.8
billion a year compared to costs under a command-and-control regulatory
alternative; other tradable-permit markets have had significant cost savings
as well (Table 9-1).

Emission Fees Versus Cap-and-Trade
As mentioned previously, one problem with emission fees is that it is difficult
to know beforehand at what level to set the fee to achieve the desired pollution reduction. This might require periodic adjustments of the fee level, and
such adjustments would introduce uncertainty that could interfere with
firms’ planning decisions. The emissions fee does, however, allow the
government to set with certainty the marginal cost of emissions reduction.
For each emission fee there is a corresponding allocation of permits that
186 | Economic Report of the President

would achieve the same results; however, it is difficult to know beforehand
what the market price for permits will be once trading actually takes place.
One way to reconcile these issues is to offer a cap-and-trade system with
a safety valve. The safety valve sets a maximum price for a permit, which
guarantees that the price of reducing emissions does not exceed the expected
benefits. The regulatory agency issues and sells extra permits on request from
any firm at this fixed safety valve price, thus guaranteeing that the market
permit price does not exceed this level. A cap-and-trade program with a
safety valve achieves the target level of emission reductions in a cost-effective
manner, while protecting the regulated firms against unexpected short-term
price increases in emissions reduction.

The President’s Cap-and-Trade Program
An example of a well-designed incentive-based regulatory approach is the
President’s Clear Skies proposal for reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide,
nitrogen oxides, and mercury from electric utility generators by approximately
70 percent by 2018. Clear Skies would cost-effectively reduce emissions by
establishing a cap-and-trade system for each of the three pollutants. The EPA
has estimated the benefits of the Clear Skies Act at $113 billion annually by
2020, compared with $6 billion in projected annual costs. These include
$110 billion in annual health benefits (including the prevention of 14,100
premature deaths and 30,000 hospitalizations and emergency room visits) and
$3 billion in annual benefits from increased visibility at national parks. Under
the existing Clean Air Act, the EPA issues national air-quality standards for
certain pollutants, including particulate matter and ozone. The EPA projects
that compared with existing programs, the Clear Skies Act would lead
35 additional eastern U.S. counties to meet the particulate matter standard by
2020, leaving only eight counties not meeting the standard. The EPA expects
that the remaining counties not meeting the standards would move closer to
achieving them due to the Clear Skies Act.
To mitigate the effects of market shocks that potentially affect the costs of
emissions reduction, Clear Skies would establish a safety valve price for
permits of each pollutant. It would also provide regulatory certainty by
achieving the reductions of all three pollutants in two phases. Firms would
therefore plan their reductions of the three pollutants together and over the
long term. Indeed, because the Clear Skies plan allows the banking of
permits for future use, it provides an incentive for firms to achieve reductions quickly. Additionally, Clear Skies would provide revenue for the
government because it phases in an auction system for the permits.
Clear Skies demonstrates the lessons learned from past regulatory experiences:
instead of imposing an inflexible, command-and-control regulation to achieve

Chapter 9

| 187

emissions reduction, it offers a market-based, cost-effective, cap-and-trade
program to achieve large reductions in emissions from electric utility generators.

Conclusion
Economic growth and environmental improvements are at times incorrectly
seen as competing aims. Increased economic production can indeed lead to
greater environmental degradation. However, an increase in economic
resources provides more options (most notably, technological advancements)
for addressing environmental problems. Moreover, a growing economy can
also lead to increased demand for environmental improvements. It is therefore
important to weigh the direct environmental benefits of a regulation against
its economic costs. The goal should be to maximize the net benefits to society,
while also giving due consideration to distributional issues. Maximizing net
benefits is best achieved in a free-market setting unless there are spillover costs
to third parties.
Spillover costs are best addressed by establishing property rights that will
lead the affected parties to negotiate a mutually-beneficial outcome. If the
costs of such negotiations are prohibitive, however, government should
respond carefully and always keep in mind the possible government spillover
costs. To make effective regulations, the government must first assess the
environmental problems using sound, unbiased estimates of the hazards and
then craft incentive-based regulations to address them. Such regulations can
address the spillover costs of environmental problems at lower costs to
society than the traditional command-and-control regulatory methods.
These principles, and the lessons learned from our past regulatory experiences, as described throughout this chapter, should guide our future
regulatory endeavors to achieve environmental improvements coupled with
economic growth and efficiency.

Health Care and Insurance

T

he breadth and pace of innovation and change in the provision of health
care in the United States over the past few decades have been no less than
astounding. Technological progress in the form of new medical knowledge,
medicines, treatments, and medical devices has allowed Americans and people
worldwide to live longer, healthier lives.
As new treatment options become available, it is not surprising that the
United States and other major industrialized countries continue to shift more
resources to health care. Research suggests that between 50 and 75 percent of
the growth rate in health expenditures in the United States is attributable to
technological progress in health care goods and services. However, the
increase in resources devoted to health care has led to concern about its
affordability, both for families worried about tight budgets and for the Nation
as a whole. A strong reliance on market mechanisms will ensure that incentives for innovation are maintained while providing high-quality care in the
most cost-efficient manner. Americans should have more choices, more
information, and more control over their health care decisions.
Health insurance plays a central role in the workings of the U.S. health care
market. An understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of health insurance
as a payment mechanism for health care is essential to the design of reforms
that retain incentives for innovation while reining in unnecessary expenditures.
This chapter discusses the roles of innovation, insurance, and reform in the
health care market. The key points in this chapter are:
• U.S. markets provide incentives to develop innovative health care products and services that benefit both Americans and the global community.
• Over reliance on health insurance as a payment mechanism leads to an
inefficient use of resources in providing and utilizing health care.
• Reforms should provide consumers and health care providers with more
flexibility and information.

189

The U.S. Health Care System as an
Engine of Innovation
Innovation and new technology have changed the practice of medicine
over the past few decades. Diagnostic tools such as magnetic resonance
imaging and computed tomography scanning have made it possible for
doctors to see otherwise invisible problems. Innovations such as balloon
angioplasty treat conditions that previously required extensive surgery.
Minimally invasive surgical techniques such as arthroscopy provide treatment options that lead to shorter hospital stays and faster recoveries.
Restorative surgeries such as hip and knee replacements are now commonplace and provide patients with improved mobility and thus improved
quality of life. New pharmaceuticals treat conditions that were previously
intractable or help to avoid more costly surgeries and lengthy hospital stays.
The list of advances is long and impressive.

The Value of Health Care Innovation
Innovation in health care goods and services, including advances in
scientific knowledge that have changed many people’s day-to-day behavior,
has markedly improved the lives of Americans. Life expectancy at birth in
the United States increased from 68.2 years in 1950 to 77.2 years in 2001.
Medical advances have also increased the quality of life through innovations
that improve mobility, sight, and hearing.
Some might argue that these advances are not unique to the United States
and that Americans spend too much for health care relative to other countries. The United States expends a higher fraction of GDP on health care than
does any other industrialized country. According to an international comparison released in 2003, the United States spent 13.9 percent of GDP on health
care in 2001, while the average among industrialized countries was 8.4
percent of GDP. Measures of health outcomes such as longevity and infant
mortality, however, are not markedly different in the United States than in
other advanced economies that spend substantially less on health care.
The argument that the U.S. health care system is overly costly relative to
other countries implicitly assumes that if two countries spend different
amounts for health care and get the same health outcomes, then the higherspending country must be inefficient and wasteful. This argument is not
correct in the case of health care for two reasons that are related to the
leading role of the United States as a source of research and innovation.

190 | Economic Report of the President

First, in general terms, while all countries can benefit from research and
development expenditures made by a single country, only the health expenditures in the innovating country will include the costs of research and
development. Health expenditures in non-innovating countries will exclude
the research and development costs.
Second, free markets incorporate incentives for innovation that generate
products, services, and knowledge that potentially benefit all countries.
Markets naturally encourage and reward innovation. Unfettered by government price controls or access restrictions, innovative products, talented
health care practitioners, and skilled health care professionals are rewarded
in the marketplace. This leads to technological advances by encouraging
talented people to participate in the health care industry and by increasing
investment in new products and research. The financial rewards for innovation will be reflected in U.S. health expenditures through a combination of
higher prices and wages, and higher usage than in other countries. Once a
product or service is developed through the combination of talent and
capital, however, it becomes available for use outside the United States.
Countries in which government regulation has supplanted market forces
will still have the opportunity to take advantage of U.S. innovation without
having to pay as much for it.
As an illustration of how U.S. health expenditures reflect the incentives
for innovation, consider products such as medical devices and pharmaceuticals. The patent system exists to encourage innovation for these types of
products. The innovator’s incentive in a patent-based system is the opportunity to hold a monopoly on a product for a limited period of time.
Therefore, the innovator can temporarily charge a higher price and earn
more profits than he would without patent protection. The higher consumer
expenditures that can result from monopoly pricing will be reflected in
health care expenditures.
Once the patent system has led to the development of a product, it is
available for use throughout the world, not just in the United States. This
leads to an opportunity for other countries with centralized health agencies
to negotiate a price close to production costs, thereby paying lower prices
than they would in a free market that fully respected patent rights. What this
implies is that other countries can reap the benefits of U.S. innovations in
health care goods and services but pay only a fraction of the costs. It follows
that if the United States attempted to reduce health expenditures by adopting
cost-control policies found in other countries, innovation would slow and
both Americans and citizens of other countries would be affected.

U.S. Leadership in Health Care Technology
Several pieces of evidence point toward the preeminence of the United
States in providing health care technology. First, since 1975, the Nobel Prize
in medicine or physiology has been awarded to more Americans than to
researchers in all other countries combined. Second, according to data
collected through 1993, 15 of the 19 marketed “biotech” drugs used for
nondiagnostic purposes were the product of U.S. companies alone. U.S.
companies shared credit with companies from other countries for two more
of the 19 drugs. As of 2002, eight of the world’s ten top-selling drugs were
produced by companies headquartered in the United States.
A third example of U.S. leadership is that many important medical
innovations in the past 30 years arguably originated in the United States.
This evidence is based on a survey designed to determine the relative importance of a variety of medical innovations developed over approximately the
last 30 years. Starting with a review of the medical literature, researchers
compiled a list of 30 major medical innovations and then surveyed over
300 leading general internists in the United States concerning the relative
importance to their patients of the innovations. Based on the survey,
researchers ranked the innovations in order of importance. The first and
second columns of Table 10-1 reflect the results for the top ten innovations.
The table also includes countries of origin, a category that was not
included in the original research. Assignment of country was based on the

location where the first clinically viable form of the innovation was developed
or produced, or where research important to its creation occurred. The
United States dominates this chart as the innovating country for these important medical developments. Of the ten, eight include the United States as a
key country. The United Kingdom and Japan, the next closest sources, are
associated with just two of the innovations each.
Table 10-1 should not be misinterpreted. Scientific advances by their
nature are evolutionary, with recent advances building upon prior discoveries. The process of identifying a single person or team for progress that
relies upon previous work is necessarily subjective. Nevertheless, such judgments are regularly made in selecting awards such as the Nobel Prize. But
even taking into account the unavoidable limitations of such a list, it does
suggest a dominant role for the United States in the development of new
and useful medical technologies.

Box 10-1: Price Regulation and the Introduction of New Drugs
A recent study suggests that pharmaceutical firms tend to avoid or
delay introducing new drugs in countries with price controls. In the study,
which includes data from 25 countries on 85 new chemical entities introduced in the United States or the United Kingdom between 1994 and
1998, the three countries that did not require price approval before launch
(the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom) introduced the
most new drugs. Analysis controlling for per capita income and other
country and firm characteristics shows that countries with lower
expected prices or smaller expected market size have fewer launches and
longer launch delays. In the European Union, where drugs can be
approved through a centralized procedure for use in the entire region,
countries with price controls still experience significant launch delays.
According to the study, the connection between price controls and
delayed access to drugs lies in the tendency for price controls to “spill
over” from one country to another. Firms have an incentive to avoid
or delay launching drugs in markets with price controls if they fear
that the low prices will “spill over” to other markets. There are two
main mechanisms by which price controls in one country can affect
pharmaceutical profits in another: parallel trade and external referencing. With parallel trade, one country can take advantage of
regulated low prices in another country through trade. With external
referencing, countries can incorporate external price controls into
domestic prices through price-setting formulas that depend on prices
in other countries. Overall, the study suggests that there is a tradeoff
between low prices and rapid access to new drugs.

Insurance Reform as a Means of Providing
Health Care More Efficiently
While the U.S. health care market provides excellent incentives for innovation,
there are legitimate concerns about cost. Rising health expenditures for families and firms can lead to difficult decisions over how best to allocate limited
budgets. Pressure on government budgets continues to increase due to major
health care programs such as Medicare (health insurance primarily for the
elderly) and Medicaid (health insurance primarily for the poor). Physicians
and hospitals struggle with government regulations, rising liability costs, and
growing administrative burdens. To craft adequate responses to such
challenges, it is important to understand the economic forces at work.
Technological progress in health care has been very beneficial, but it has
led to growth in health care expenditures as the new technology has been
applied to increase the length and to improve the quality of life. Research
suggests that between 50 and 75 percent of the growth rate in health expenditures in the United States is attributable to technological progress in health
care goods and services. Potential sources of the remaining 25 to 50 percent
of the growth rate include: higher demand for health care due to increasing
incomes and the aging of the U.S. population; the increased practice of
“defensive medicine” (that is, medical procedures with limited therapeutic
value that are performed by physicians to avoid lawsuits); and increased use
of health insurance plans as a payment mechanism for health care.
There are various ways to reduce health care costs. Reducing the incentive
to practice defensive medicine has the potential to lower the level of health
care costs and is therefore an important objective. Modifying the health insurance system offers an especially attractive target for cost-saving reform because
it would affect both the level and the growth rate of health expenditures.
Reforms could be targeted to reduce administrative costs and the incentive to
overuse health insurance as a payment mechanism. Understanding the
strengths and the weaknesses of the health insurance system is central to developing policies that will lead to more cost-effective health care and to greater
access to health care for those underserved by the current market.

The Appropriate Use of Insurance
Insurance is an indispensable tool in modern economies. Individuals
insure automobiles against the possibility of an accident and homes against
the possibility of a fire. Life insurance provides financial security to loved
ones in case of an untimely demise. In each of these examples, the basic
principle is the same: for a fee—the insurance premium—the insurer
promises that some financial benefit will be forthcoming if a well-defined
event takes place such as a car accident, a house fire, or a death.
194 | Economic Report of the President

Insurance is a valuable economic commodity. By giving up some income
in the form of a premium, a consumer can avoid the large decline in wealth
associated with an unfortunate event. Even if the event does not occur, a
consumer benefits from the reduced uncertainty provided by insurance.
Insurance is generally not needed when there is little uncertainty or when
financial risks are small. For example, insurance policies usually do not pay
for items such as groceries, clothing, or gasoline, although it would certainly
be possible to create such policies. Suppose, for example, that an individual
could purchase a clothing insurance policy with a “coinsurance” rate of
20 percent, meaning that after paying the insurance premium, the holder of
the insurance policy would have to pay only 20 cents on the dollar for all
clothing purchases. An individual with such a policy would be expected to
spend substantially more on clothes—due to larger quantity and higher
quality purchases—with the 80 percent discount than he would at the full
price. However, the insurance company would need to charge a high
premium to cover expenses. The premium would need to cover the
80 percent discount on the clothing that the individual would have bought
had he or she been paying full price. Additionally, the premium would need
to cover the insurer’s expense for clothes purchased because the individual
buys clothes as if they cost only 20 cents on the dollar. Few individuals
would find such an expensive policy cost-effective.

Moral Hazard
The clothing insurance example suggests an inherent inefficiency in the
use of insurance to pay for things that have little intrinsic risk or uncertainty.
It also illustrates the broader problem in insurance markets known as moral
hazard. Moral hazard refers to the idea that policy holders will make
different choices when they are covered by an insurance policy than when
they are not, but the insurer cannot fully monitor or restrict their actions. In
the clothing example, moral hazard results in insured individuals spending
more on clothing than they would without insurance.
Optimal insurance contracts must balance the value that consumers place
on reducing their exposure to risk against the inefficiency arising from moral
hazard. In the absence of uncertainty, insurance is wasteful because moral
hazard will lead to excessive use and there is no benefit to the consumer from
risk-reduction. Inefficient use of insurance will be reflected in an unnecessarily high cost for insurance. Standard features of insurance contracts such
as coinsurance rates, copayments, and deductibles are attempts to mitigate
the moral hazard problem. Even so, inefficiencies of this sort are pervasive
in the U.S. health care system.

Chapter 10

| 195

Adverse Selection
Another issue that arises in discussions of insurance markets is adverse
selection. Adverse selection occurs when an insurance policy attracts certain
types of people, and the insurer cannot identify these people before they
enroll. If the premium is based on the average individual, but the policy
disproportionately attracts those who spend more than the average person
(in the clothing example, individuals with particularly expensive tastes in
clothes), the policy will lose money for the insurer. The policy will then
either increase in price or not last in the marketplace.
Adverse selection illustrates a problem that exists when the consumer
knows more about his or her characteristics than the insurer. As a result there
is a market inefficiency where, in the extreme, some consumers do not
purchase insurance because the only policy available to them is priced for the
most expensive consumers. If insurers could distinguish among different
types of consumers, policies could be tailored to specific types and priced
accordingly. With better information, an efficiently functioning insurance
market would be able to provide insurance in a way that would maximize
individual consumer welfare.

Health Insurance in the United States
Health insurance in the United States has several unique features. First,
the employer portion of premiums for employer-provided health insurance
is generally exempt from income and payroll taxes. The employee portion of
premiums is similarly tax-exempt for the roughly one-half of workers
covered by tax-advantaged health plans. This leads to the second, and unsurprising, feature, which is that most health insurance is provided through
employers. Over 60 percent of all individuals in the United States have
employer-provided health insurance. The central role of employer provision
makes health insurance very different from other types of insurance, such as
fire and car insurance.
Third, health insurance policies in the United States also tend to cover
many events that have little uncertainty, such as routine dental care, annual
medical exams, and vaccinations. For these types of predictable expenses,
health insurance is more like prepaid preventative care than true insurance. If
automobile insurance were structured like the typical health policy, it would
cover annual maintenance, tire replacement, and possibly even car washes.
Fourth, health insurance tends to cover relatively low-expense items, such
as an office visit to the doctor for a sore throat. Although often unforeseeable,
this expense would not have a major financial impact on most people. To
continue the analogy, it would be similar to car insurance covering relatively
small expenses such as replacing worn brakes.

Box 10-2: Who are the Uninsured?
The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that in 2002, 242.4 million
people in the United States had health insurance for the entire year,
while the remaining 43.6 million people were uninsured.
Uninsurance persists in the face of public programs such as Medicare,
Medicaid, and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. In
general, these programs provide health insurance to the elderly, the
very poor, and the children of the moderately poor, respectively.
The uninsured are a diverse and perpetually changing group. The
Congressional Budget Office claims that due to sampling techniques,
the U.S. Census Bureau estimate of 43.6 million (15.2 percent of the
population) more closely represents the number of people who are
uninsured at a point in time than the number of people who are uninsured for an entire year. Just under half of all new spells of
uninsurance end within four months. The number of people who were
uninsured for all of 1998 (the most recent year for which comparative
survey data are available) is estimated to have been 21 million to
31 million (7.6 to 11.2 percent of the population).
Some individuals included in survey-based counts of the uninsured
may in fact have access to public coverage. For instance, the number
of people who report having Medicaid is smaller than the number
determined to be enrolled based on the program’s administrative
data. The reasons for this discrepancy are not well understood.
People might fail to report this coverage because of a possible stigma
associated with being on Medicaid or because the survey questions
are confusing. In addition, some individuals who are uninsured are
eligible for Medicaid but have not enrolled. These people are counted
as uninsured in surveys, but they are effectively insured because they
can enroll in Medicaid should they require medical treatment.
Others who lack insurance coverage possess economic or
demographic characteristics that suggest many of them may remain
uninsured as a matter of choice. For example, some have levels of
household income that are above the median for the population.
Over 32 percent of uninsured individuals report a household income
of $50,000 or more. Others have access to employer-provided
coverage but do not opt to participate. Researchers believe that as
many as one-quarter of those without health insurance had coverage
available through an employer but declined the coverage. Still others
may remain uninsured because they are young and healthy and
do not see the need for insurance. In fact, more than two-fifths of
uninsured individuals are between the ages of 18 and 34.

Box 10-2 — continued

Finally, many of the people included in domestic estimates of
uninsurance are citizens of other countries. Over 8.9 million of the
43.6 million people included in the U.S. Census Bureau estimate of the
uninsured are not U.S. citizens. This includes both legal immigrants
and foreign-born individuals with non-immigrant status, such as
students, diplomats, and undocumented individuals.

A Brief History of Health Insurance in the
United States
The historical background of health insurance coverage in the United States
helps explain why health insurance is different from other types of insurance.
In the early twentieth century, health insurance tended to cover wage loss
rather than payment for medical services. This insurance is comparable to
present-day disability insurance or workers’ compensation. Limited health care
coverage reflected the small number of options available to the medical profession for improving health—there were few costly treatments to insure against.
The first modern health insurance policy appears to have been started in
1929 when a group of teachers contracted with Baylor University Hospital.
For an annual premium of $6, the policy guaranteed up to three weeks of
hospital coverage. Providing insurance through employers, rather than to
individuals, lowered administrative costs for insurers. It also mitigated the
problems from adverse selection because the insured group was formed
without regard to health status.
Employer-based coverage was encouraged by legal provisions during World
War II that allowed employers to compete for employees by offering health
benefits during a period of wage and price controls. Separately, a 1943 administrative tax court ruled that some employers’ payments for group medical
coverage on behalf of employees were not taxable as employee income.
A consequence of exempting premiums paid on employer-provided
insurance is that tax receipts to the Federal government are lower than they
otherwise would be. It has been estimated that Federal tax receipts in 2001 were
about $120 billion lower as a result of the tax exemption. Research suggests that
the tax preference for insurance induces people to buy more expansive health
insurance—for example, people buy policies that cover a broad array of health
services—and policies that have low deductibles and low coinsurance rates,
which lead to the associated inefficiencies from moral hazard.

198 | Economic Report of the President

To summarize, health insurance markets can be improved in at least three
ways. The first is to encourage contracts that focus on large expenditures
that are truly the result of unforeseen circumstances. The second is to
strengthen health insurance markets outside the traditional employer-based
group markets. The third is to provide a more standardized tax treatment of
all health care expenditures.

Proposals for Modernizing the
Health Care Market
Health insurance reforms have the potential to increase the costeffectiveness of health care markets without sacrificing the incentives that are
essential to continued innovation. Reforms that lead to more direct interaction between consumers and health care providers, relying less on
third-party payers such as insurance companies, have the potential to
increase the efficiency and therefore the cost-effectiveness of health care
markets. Coupled with changes that provide consumers with more flexibility
and more information, such reforms would continue to provide the market
signals important for developing new and useful health care innovations.
The President has proposed several reforms that promise to move the Nation
in the direction of achieving these goals. Taken together, these reforms will
help preserve the innovative strengths that have proven so valuable to
Americans and will improve the efficiency of the U.S. health care system.

Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement,
and Modernization Act of 2003
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of
2003, enacted in December, adds a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare
program. The new drug benefit will give more Medicare beneficiaries access
to prescription drug coverage and will provide benefits for individuals with
limited means and low incomes. A prescription drug discount card will be
available for beneficiaries until the full drug benefit is available nationwide.
The Act also establishes another key element of the President’s health care
agenda, Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). With an HSA, individuals and
their employers may contribute pretax dollars to fund an account that can
then be used to pay for medical expenses. Once established, this money
belongs to the individual and can accumulate over time. The account
remains with the individual if he or she changes employers. With such
accounts, there is an increased incentive to purchase insurance that only

Chapter 10

| 199

covers events that are truly random and large, and to pay for other expenses
using an HSA. Indeed, the law requires that such accounts be coupled with
a high-deductible insurance plan.
With less reliance on insurance for routine health expenses, consumers
would place a greater value on information about health care options and
providers. More prudent use of insurance would also reduce “middle-man”
costs of involving an insurance company in what could otherwise be a
simple transaction between the patient and the caregiver.

Next Steps in Improving Health Care Markets
The passage of the Medicare bill was a major accomplishment, but much
remains to be done. A number of proposals on the President’s agenda for
health care reform would lead to improvements in the health care market.

Association Health Plans (AHPs)
The AHP proposal enables small businesses and associations to purchase
health insurance for employees and their families. These plans offer small
businesses and self-employed individuals the potential for lower health
insurance premiums resulting from decreased administrative costs and
increased bargaining power with insurers and medical providers.

New Tax Deduction for Health Insurance Premiums
The President has proposed a new tax deduction for health insurance
premiums. Individuals who purchase a high-deductible insurance policy
coupled with an HSA would be able to deduct the value of the insurance
premium from their income taxes even if they do not itemize their deductions. This would encourage the use of high-deductible insurance by
providing a tax benefit similar to that given to employer-provided insurance.

Refundable Health Credit
Many workers do not have the option to obtain insurance through their
employment. The President has proposed a refundable health credit that
could be used to purchase insurance. This credit will help expand health care
access for low- and middle-income workers who do not have good employerbased coverage options.

200 | Economic Report of the President

Reducing the Cost of Medical Care Through Liability Reform
Malpractice premiums are a significant cost for physicians and hospitals.
The President has proposed the national adoption of standards to make the
medical liability system more fair, predictable, and timely. Adoption of these
proposals would lower the cost of providing health care (see the discussion
of this subject in Chapter 11, The Tort System). Similarly, fear of litigation
keeps health care providers from sharing vital information on quality problems and medical errors. The President has called for legislation to allay these
fears and make it possible for health professionals to share information to
reduce errors and complications.

Improving Efficiency Through the Use of Health Information
Technology
The use of information technology in health care holds the promise of
reducing medical errors, facilitating communication between care providers
and patients, and reducing administrative costs. Computerized physician
order entry, a type of technology that allows physicians to write medication
orders electronically, has been shown to reduce significantly the rate of
serious medication errors. Intensive care telemedicine, a type of technology
that allows remote specialists to monitor patients continuously with videoconferencing and computer-based data transmission tools, has been found
to decrease intensive care costs substantially in certain settings. The
President is proposing to double the funding (for a total of $100 million) for
the Department of Health and Human Services to increase the use of these
new technologies through demonstration projects.

Conclusion
The U.S. health care system has provided tremendous benefits for both
American citizens and the global community. New knowledge, innovative
products, and life-saving medical procedures are the results of the U.S. market
for health care. The proposed policies will help preserve the strengths of the
U.S. market and will improve the efficiency and affordability of health care.

The Tort System

T

ort is the civil law through which injured individuals seek compensation
from another party alleged to have caused or contributed to their
injury. The tort system in the United States is intended to compensate accident victims and to deter potential defendants from putting others at risk.
Expenditures in the U.S. tort system were $233.4 billion in 2002, equal to
2.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), more than twice the amount
spent on new automobiles in 2002. The expansive tort system has a considerable impact on the U.S. economy. Tort liability leads to lower spending on
research and development, higher health care costs, and job losses. This
chapter examines the growth of the tort system, the benefits the United States
receives from it, and how alternative injury-compensation systems compare
with the present tort system in terms of costs.
The key points of the chapter are:
• The evidence is mixed on whether the tort system serves to deter
negligent behavior.
• The tort system is a costly method of providing insurance against
injuries, and has a number of adverse effects on the economy.
• Possible ways of reducing the burden of the tort system include limiting
noneconomic damages, reforming class action procedures, setting up
trust funds for payments to victims, and allowing parties to avoid the
tort system contractually.

The Changing Role of Tort Law
Until the 1960s, tort law covered injuries involving strangers, such as those
caused by automobile accidents. Injuries resulting from the interaction
between individuals with a prior relationship, such as physicians and patients,
were covered by contract law instead of torts, which enabled individuals to
define the terms the court would use to resolve any injury disputes in advance.
This division between the tort system and contracts limited the courts’ role to
hearing cases involving injuries in which one person had harmed another with
no predetermined specification of damages by the parties—either because no
contract existed or because the existing contract did not cover a particular set
of circumstances. In essence, the courts’ job was to decide if the defendant was
203

liable (at fault) and to determine compensation for the plaintiff (the victim).
An important feature of the legal environment was that courts assigned
liability for an injury by applying the negligence standard, under which the
court assessed whether the injury had occurred because the defendant had
failed to exercise the caution of a reasonable person under the circumstances
of the accident. Changes to tort law since the 1960s have altered the standard of care courts apply in considering claims for compensation. Although
some tort cases, such as those alleging medical liability, still use the negligence standard, others, such as product liability, are now generally decided
using strict liability. Under this standard, defendants are held responsible for
any product-related injuries even if they were not negligent. More injuries
have become eligible for compensation as a result of this change, thus
increasing the number of injuries litigated in the tort system.
Another change since the 1960s is that the tort system now serves to
provide insurance against harms relating to any goods or services consumers
or businesses purchase. This function is in addition to the original purpose
of punishing negligence in order to deter future injuries. The right to sue for
damages means that the tort system today effectively obligates suppliers of
goods and services to provide this insurance along with their products. As
recently as the late 1950s, ladder manufacturers would not have been liable
for falls from ladders, doctors would not have been liable for birth defects,
and diving-board manufacturers would not have been liable for injuries
resulting from diving; in today’s tort system, they are. Courts used to
presume that falls from ladders were caused by deviations from normal use
and not, as is currently the case, that ladder manufacturers were potentially
liable for not warning consumers about the dangers of their product.

The Expansion of Tort Costs
Expenditures associated with the tort system have risen along with its
increased role in society. One estimate based on insurance industry data
finds that aggregate expenditures in the tort system were $233.4 billion in
2002. This estimate includes the legal costs of defending policyholders,
benefits paid to parties injured by policyholders, insurance companies’
administrative costs, and estimates of medical liability and self-insurance
costs. Tort costs as a percentage of GDP increased after 1974 and peaked in
1987 (Chart 11-1).
The number of injuries handled in the tort system has increased along
with expenditures. The number of filings per capita started to rise in the
early 1980s and peaked in the mid-1980s, at least in the 16 states for which
data on lawsuit filings are available between 1975 and 2000 (Chart 11-2).
204 | Economic Report of the President

Much of the decline in filings since 1985 appears to have occurred in
California, where medical liability reforms included a $250,000 limit for
noneconomic damages that was found constitutional in 1985. Although
there has been a decline in cases per capita since the 1980s, some types of
tort awards have increased. For example, between 1990 and 2001, the
median award in medical liability cases increased from about $100,000 to
more than $300,000.
Expenditures in the tort system vary by the type of dispute (Table 11-1). In
auto cases plaintiffs received a median award of $18,000 (in 57.5 percent of
the cases). The most expensive cases tended to be those in which plaintiffs and
defendants had preexisting relationships, such as product liability and medical
liability. Plaintiffs won 23.4 percent of the time in medical liability cases and
received a median award of $286,000. The median award in asbestos cases
tried in state courts was $309,000, with 56 percent of plaintiffs receiving
compensation. Large awards are relatively rare. In the 75 largest counties in the
United States in 1992, 73 percent of the 377,421 tort cases disposed in state
courts concerned auto accidents, which tend to result in relatively small
awards at trial.

The Economic Effects of the Tort System
The economic effects of the tort system go beyond their direct impact in
terms of expenditures. Resources that could be directed toward productive
uses are diverted instead to the tort system or dissipated as firms and individuals take actions not needed for actual safety concerns but rather to avoid
exposure to tort liability. Studies suggest that the gains to society from tort
compensation and deterrence do not make up for these losses. A study of the
impact of tort reform on productivity finds that limitations on the size of tort
claims (for example, caps on punitive damages) enacted by states from 1972
to 1990 increased productivity by 1 to 2 percent a year, an amount equal to
$955 per worker per year in 2002 dollars. Limitations on tort awards moved
some injury payments out of the tort system so that the $955 figure
represents an estimate of the cost of the tort system over alternative systems.
The gains from limits on the tort system come about because torts cause
firms and individuals such as medical professionals to change the way they
do business. Firms choose not to sell certain products so that they can avoid
potential liability or they take costly extra precautions in the delivery of their
products and services—precautions beyond the level that would reasonably
balance costs and benefits to society. For example, torts cause doctors to
practice defensive medicine, such as ordering extra tests that are a waste of
time and resources. Some expenditures in the tort system, such as compensation for damages, are transfers of money from defendants to plaintiffs and
do not consume resources. Other expenditures involve true economic costs
in that the resources involved are not available for more productive uses;
attorney’s fees are an example. Additional costs include the profits and
consumer benefits forgone by society when a potential defendant removes a
product or service from the market or does not produce it in the first place
in order to avoid frivolous lawsuits.

Torts as Injury Compensation
The tort system is not the only way in which society can deter injuries and
compensate victims. There is an extensive system of regulations to improve
the safety of products, medicines, and many other goods and services.
Consumers have access to numerous publications and Internet Web sites
that offer reviews and facilitate discussions of products. The availability of
this information on product safety provides producers with a powerful
financial incentive to make their products safer.
The question then becomes whether another system could provide the
same benefits in terms of compensation and deterrence as the tort system
but at lower cost. There is not enough evidence to determine the answer to
Chapter 11

| 207

this broad question. Nevertheless, some evidence indicates that in certain
areas, such as product liability and medical liability, the tort system does not
deliver enough deterrence benefits to justify the associated administrative
costs (such as legal fees, overhead to process insurance claims, and the cost
of running the tort system itself ).

The Principal Injury-Compensation Methods
Injury-compensation systems can be broadly classified by the type of act
that leads to the compensation being provided. A fault-based system compensates the injured party on the basis of negligent action, intentional harm, or
strict liability. In contrast, a cause-based system is one in which the specific
cause of the injury entitles an individual to compensation. The most widespread cause-based program in the United States is workers’ compensation,
which pays for many workplace injuries regardless of whether the employer
was negligent with regard to the worker’s injury. Finally, loss-based systems pay
compensation based only on injury or illness. Loss-based systems include
private systems like health insurance and public systems like Medicare.
The tort system is not the principal means by which injuries are compensated. Private health insurance, Medicaid, and Medicare are all substantially
larger providers of compensation than the tort system (Table 11-2). The
portion of tort expenditures that covers only economic damages such as
current and future lost wages (that is, not including noneconomic damages
such as for pain and suffering) is comparable in size to either the workers’
compensation system or payments for life insurance.

Administrative Costs
The tort system is one of the most expensive compensation systems to
run, with administrative costs equal to 54 percent of benefits. Sixty-one
percent of these administrative costs (about a third of every dollar spent in
the tort system) are the legal fees generated by attorneys for plaintiffs and
defendants. In 2001, administrative costs of the health insurance industry
were around 14 percent of benefits paid. The overhead for the Social
Security disability system was around 3 percent of benefits in 2003; a study
from the mid-1980s found that workers’ compensation had overhead costs
of around 20 percent of benefits. Some of the high cost of the tort system
may arise because it deals with accidents that are more difficult to evaluate
than those of other injury-compensation mechanisms.

February 2002.

Compensation of Noneconomic Losses
Another way in which the tort system differs from other compensation
methods is that it forces consumers to accept not only coverage for economic
losses such as current and future lost wages and medical costs, but also nonpecuniary losses such as pain and suffering. Of the 46 cents of each dollar spent
in the tort system that goes to plaintiffs, on average, 22 cents compensates them
for economic losses and 24 cents compensates them for noneconomic damages.
Damages paid through the tort system are costs to firms—and higher costs
ultimately translate into higher prices for goods and services. Tort awards can
thus be seen as a form of insurance: consumers pay “premiums” in the form of
higher prices for goods and services and receive compensation if injured. Torts
cover only a limited set of possible injuries, however, so a consumer seeking
comprehensive insurance against all possible economic and noneconomic losses
would still have to purchase additional insurance. In reality, few people buy
insurance against noneconomic losses such as pain and suffering; people do buy
insurance against economic losses such as lost wages, medical expenses, or costs
to rebuild a damaged house. This suggests that insurance policies against
noneconomic losses are not worth their cost to potential buyers.
Chapter 11

| 209

Extent of Coverage
Despite the expansion of the tort system, torts still provide compensation
for a relatively limited number of injuries compared to other systems such
as health insurance. For example, injuries that are the sole fault of the victim
do not give rise to a legal claim for compensation and hence do not fall
under the purview of the tort system. Many injuries are too small in
economic terms to justify litigation. The long delays inherent before the tort
system delivers monetary compensation likely also dissuade many potential
lawsuits from being filed. In tort cases resolved in the 75 largest counties in
the United States in 1992, the median time from filing to disposition was
just over two years, with nearly one out of six cases taking more than four
years. For medical liability, the median time to resolution was nearly three
years with almost three out of ten cases taking longer than four years.
There is evidence that the eventual compensation does not match the
injury well. In medical liability cases, the tort system appears to overcompensate minor injuries relative to the compensation that would have been
provided by private insurance, while more serious injuries are undercompensated. This discrepancy may exist because factors other than the medical
specifics of the injury could affect the compensation received by the plaintiff. For example, the location of the trial and the composition of the jury
pool appear to affect the verdicts of some tort lawsuits and the size of the
compensation. In addition, compensation may be tied more to the ability of
the defendant to pay than to the actual injury suffered by the plaintiff. This
is particularly a concern for punitive damages (Box 11-1).
Moreover, the tort system does a poor job of identifying which injuries are
entitled to compensation and which are not. Many injuries that would meet the
legal definition of negligence are never pursued, and the majority of those that
are pursued appear not to merit compensation. A 1984 study of the outcomes
of hospitalizations in New York City found that 3 to 4 percent of hospitalizations gave rise to adverse events such as drug reactions, with just over
one-quarter of these due to negligent actions. However, more than half of the
medical liability claims actually filed in the tort system arose from circumstances
in which neither negligence nor any identifiable injury was present. One-third
arose from instances in which the patient was injured but the doctor was not
negligent (for example, for injuries resulting from a previously unknown drug
allergy). Only one-sixth of the cases identified instances of true negligence and
injury. Moreover, in this study, these claims represented a small fraction of
injuries that actually arose due to negligence. Consequently, the majority of the
compensation went to people who were not injured or were not injured by the
doctor accused of malpractice, while the majority of those actually injured by
doctor error were not compensated at all. Only in a minority of cases did those
legally entitled to compensation receive it through the legal system.
210 | Economic Report of the President

Box 11-1: Punitive Damages
Compensatory damages are intended to “make the plaintiff whole”
by offsetting an injured victim’s losses. Punitive damages, on the
other hand, are intended to punish the party whose negligent action
caused the injury. Defendants may be liable for punitive damages if a
jury finds that their actions were malicious, oppressive, gross, willful
and wanton, or fraudulent. The Department of Justice studied civil trial
cases in the country’s 75 largest counties and found that punitive
damages were awarded in 4.5 percent of cases that plaintiffs won (or
2.3 percent of all cases), but represented 21 percent of all damages
awarded to plaintiffs. The median punitive award was $40,000 in those
cases in which the plaintiff received an award. The threat posed by
large punitive damages is that they may encourage more frequent
and larger settlements.
Some are concerned that punitive damages are awarded against
companies because they have deep pockets rather than because they
have behaved egregiously. Indeed, the Supreme Court has expressed
unease over the fact that the size of certain punitive awards has
seemed out of proportion to the wrongfulness of the defendant’s
actions. This capriciousness also has implications for the deterrence
effect of punitive damages, because a deterrence effect can be realized only if firms are able to take specific actions to avoid liability. If
firms cannot tell which actions will likely incur liability, they cannot
avoid them. Anecdotal evidence suggests that punitive-damage
awards can indeed be unpredictable. Two identical allegations of fraud
against BMW were heard in the same Alabama court and before the
same judge. One purchaser was awarded $4 million in punitive
damages; the second purchaser received no punitive damages.

Torts As Deterrence
The threat of a lawsuit can create and enforce appropriate standards of
behavior. If the tort system made products and services in the United States
safer, fewer accidents would occur and the higher administrative cost of torts
would provide benefits to society in terms of reduced injury rates and associated health care costs. For example, the move by a number of states to
no-fault automobile insurance in the 1970s appears to have led to as much as
a 15 percent increase in the highway fatality rate. Such no-fault auto insurance laws eliminate or restrict liability for auto accidents so that each driver’s
own insurer typically pays for his or her own accident costs regardless of how
Chapter 11

| 211

the accident happened. Drivers who know that they will not be financially
liable for other drivers’ injuries in the event of an accident might be expected
to take fewer safety precautions than if they were responsible for the financial
consequences of their actions. In other areas of tort law such as medical
liability and product liability, there is not consistent evidence that deterrence
effects are large enough to justify the considerable administrative costs of the
tort system. This suggests that alternatives to the tort system provide deterrence. For example, the possibility of losing a medical license could provide
an adequate incentive for doctors to take steps to avoid negligence beyond the
steps doctors take in the interests of their patients.

General Aviation and Deterrence
The experience of the general aviation industry over the past several
decades provides an example of the role of tort liability in affecting product
safety, firm profits, and the availability of goods to consumers. General aviation is the segment of the aviation industry composed of all civil aircraft not
flown by commercial airlines or the military. General aviation manufacturers
were the targets of a large volume of litigation in the 1970s and 1980s.
The general aviation accident rate has been declining for 50 years (Chart
11-3). In 1963, court rulings made lawsuits alleging manufacturing defects
in the design of private and commercial aircraft subject to strict liability. In
the most extreme cases, this meant that firms were responsible for accidents
even if the accidents were caused by product defects that were not known or
knowable at the time of manufacture. By the mid-1970s, this change in the
law had led to a sharp rise in the number of product-liability cases and
increased liability costs for the general aviation industry, with liability
awards increasing nearly ninefold from 1977 to 1985.
The merits of these product-liability claims against airplane manufacturers
were subject to question. A study of a sample of general aviation lawsuits filed
between 1983 and 1986 showed that none of the accidents that led to
lawsuits was caused by a design or manufacturing defect, as each suit had
claimed. Thus, these lawsuits did not give manufacturers any additional
incentives to produce safer aircraft, since the allegations of design defects
appear to have been specious in the first place.
Indeed, the rise in tort claims had no discernible effect on the accident
rate. An examination of the trends in the accident rate calculated over
various periods shows that the steepest decline in general aviation accidents
occurred between 1950 and 1969—before the dramatic rise in tort costs in
the 1970s and 1980s (Chart 11-4). If liability exposure were driving the
general aviation industry to build safer products, accident rates would have
declined more rapidly as the increased likelihood of tort litigation pushed
aircraft manufacturers to add safety features to their aircraft.

The rise in liability expenses did, however, cause great harm to the general
aviation industry. During the period of expanding liability costs from 1977
to 1985, the financial health of the general aviation industry deteriorated
markedly, with a number of firms shutting down production lines and one
going bankrupt. As a result, small-aircraft production fell precipitously
(Chart 11-5). By discouraging the production of new planes, tort law has
created a situation in which the mix of planes in use actually presents a higher
risk than would have been the case had older planes been retired and replaced
by new ones. The General Aviation Revitalization Act of 1994, which
exempted some general aviation aircraft older than 18 years from productliability claims, appears to have led to a small resurgence in the industry.

Other Evidence on Deterrence
It is difficult to find deterrence effects in other contexts. For example,
studies examining injury rates for consumers and workers as well as death
rates from workplace injuries show that such injuries did not decline more
rapidly following a steep increase in litigation. Other research has examined
the deterrence effect of medical liability by estimating the impact on treatment outcomes of state-imposed limits on damage awards at trial (such as
California’s $250,000 limit on noneconomic damages). Studies have found
no appreciable impact on treatment outcomes—the lower threat of torts did
not lead to more medical injuries. These findings suggest that there is at best
limited deterrence from such cases.

The Limits of Tort Deterrence
Why does the tort system appear to be ineffective in improving product
safety? One major reason is that market incentives already provide an important form of deterrence against unsafe products. Firms whose products cause
injuries lose customers and suffer economic losses. In addition, many products and services face government regulation. The producers of such items
are required to undertake investments in safety, and the tort system may
have no incremental effect on safety. Similarly, medical services also face
market incentives and regulation by governmental and professional bodies.
The current tort system makes it hard to predict which actions will be
deemed negligent during litigation. Thus, the system does not provide much
deterrence because people do not know what steps to take to avoid a lawsuit
or an adverse judgment.

Potential Tort Reforms
One way to consider the effects of changes in the U.S. tort system is to
compare the U.S. system with those in other advanced economies, such as
Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom. Like the United States, many of
these countries use a negligence standard for medical liability and strict
liability for product-related injuries, yet they expend fewer resources in their
tort systems than the United States (Chart 11-6). Possible explanations for
this divergence are discussed in the following sections.

Chapter 11

| 215

Limiting Noneconomic Damages and Other Potential
Reforms
One important reason for the divergence in tort costs between the United
States and other countries is that awards for noneconomic damages, such as
pain and suffering, appear to be much higher in the United States.
Noneconomic damages account for half of all compensation awarded in the
United States, but in other countries are either capped (as in Canada) or
otherwise restricted (as in Germany). Reforms aimed at reducing or eliminating pain and suffering awards, such as the President’s proposed $250,000
limitation on noneconomic damages in health-related cases, have the potential to reduce the cost of the U.S. tort system.
Several other differences appear to be less important in explaining the
divergence than compensation for noneconomic damages. One difference is
that in other countries, judges decide the vast majority of tort claims, while
juries typically decide cases in the United States. Empirical evidence suggests
that U.S. judges and juries decide cases in approximately the same way,
suggesting this is not a major factor in explaining the divergence. Another
difference is that in the United States each side pays its own legal costs,
whereas in many other nations the losing side pays both sides’ legal costs. A
study of Florida’s temporary use of a “loser-pays” method in medical liability
216 | Economic Report of the President

cases found that when the losing side paid legal expenses, plaintiffs were
more likely to receive compensation either at trial or in a settlement.
Furthermore, the compensation was higher. This finding suggests that
apportioning legal costs to the losers discourages plaintiffs from pursuing
low-quality (nuisance) cases because they would have to pay all legal costs if
the case went against them.

Procedural Reforms
Some of the costs of the tort system arise because there are incentives that
encourage state judges and juries to extract financial compensation from outof-town defendants. The vast majority of tort cases are litigated in state courts.
Tort cases tried before elected state judges have been found to result in higher
awards when the defendant is a corporation headquartered outside of the state
than when the defendant is local. By removing national class action suits from
state courts, the Federal government could reduce the ability of entrepreneurial lawyers to forum shop, that is, to file cases in a sympathetic state court.
Some evidence on asbestos tort litigation suggests that forum shopping is
indeed a problem. Research also suggests that certain small counties tend to be
magnets for national class actions in the sense that they attract many more
cases than would be expected on the basis of their populations.
The Class Action Fairness Act of 2003 would allow removal of some class
actions to Federal court if any plaintiff is from a different state than any
defendant (Box 11-2). Under current law, a plaintiff ’s attorney who does not
like a particular judge’s limitations in a class action can seek a less restrictive
judge in a different jurisdiction. The proposed Act would make this more
difficult by reducing the ability of plaintiffs’ attorneys to file national class
actions in state court.

Limiting the Scope of Tort Compensation
An alternative approach to the current system would be to resolve disputes
and compensate victims outside the tort system. An example of this
approach is the case of compensation for individuals exposed to asbestos.
The proposed Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2003 would
create a trust fund to compensate those injured by asbestos exposure.
Disbursements from the fund would be restricted to those who are actually
suffering from asbestos-related illnesses. The use of asbestos has been all but
abandoned in the United States, so the focus in resolving claims is now
appropriately placed on compensating injured workers rather than deterring
new instances of future liability (Box 11-3).

Chapter 11

| 217

Box 11-2: The Role of Class Actions in the Tort System
A class action is a legal procedure in which individuals are joined
together to litigate a single case (the class refers to the group of such
individuals). Class actions are used in a variety of contexts, including
cases involving securities fraud, consumer protection, employment,
civil rights, and exposure to toxic chemicals or other pollutants. Class
actions are intended to secure compensation in cases that involve
substantial aggregate losses but relatively small individual losses. In
practice, private attorneys often initiate these cases, each one in effect
becoming a “Private Attorney General. In this role, lawyers identify
”
both the legal violations and a number of individuals harmed by the
violations and bring an action on these individuals’ behalf. To induce
attorneys to take on this role, they are compensated out of the settlement fund. In many cases, this compensation is based on a contingent
fee, a percentage of the settlement or award.
An important concern about class action suits is that many of them
are filed more for the benefit of the plaintiffs’ attorneys than for the
plaintiffs. In individual litigation, plaintiffs enter a contract with an
attorney and have an incentive to monitor the attorney’s effort to
ensure a favorable outcome. In class action suits, most individual
plaintiffs have only a small stake in the case’s outcome and thus have
little incentive to monitor the activities of their lawyers. In principle,
judges are expected to monitor payments to plaintiffs’ attorneys and
the nature of settlements. With growing caseloads, however, many
judges face pressure to clear their dockets as rapidly as possible.
Accepting a settlement and associated attorneys’ fees is one way to
accomplish this.
Without the active scrutiny of clients or judges, plaintiffs’ lawyers
have an incentive to collude with defendants to set higher attorney’s
fees in exchange for lower overall payouts from defendants to plaintiffs. One study of a small number of class action cases found that in
a substantial fraction of them, class counsel received more in fees and
expenses than all of the plaintiffs combined.

218 | Economic Report of the President

Box 11-3: Asbestos and the Tort System
The tort system’s treatment of asbestos cases demonstrates how the
system can fall short of its purported objectives of deterring harmful
behavior and funding compensation. Beginning in the 1970s, increased
public awareness and concern about the health effects of asbestos led
to regulations limiting exposure to asbestos. By 1989, all new uses were
banned, and strict regulations have limited remaining asbestos use.
Between 1973 and 2001, asbestos use in the United States fell by 98
percent. With extensive regulations in place and minimal use, the tort
system’s role in deterring harmful behavior has been substantially
reduced simply because there is little activity to deter.
Yet even as the use of asbestos declined, the number of claims rose
substantially. The total number of claimants is estimated to have grown
from 21,000 in 1982 to over 600,000 by the end of 2000. To be sure,
some additional claims are warranted because cancers caused by
asbestos can take years to develop. An estimated 90 percent of the new
claims, however, are by people who have no cancers and may never
develop cancer. Claims by individuals without a diagnosed asbestosrelated cancer account for almost all of the growth in asbestos case
loads during the 1990s and most of the compensation received by
claimants goes to those without malignant cancers. Only 43 percent of
the money spent on asbestos litigation is recovered by claimants—the
rest goes to lawyers and administrative costs. In short, the current
system neither achieves deterrence in the use of this dangerous
substance nor directs appropriate compensation to its victims.
Instead, asbestos litigation has imposed costs on workers, shareholders, and those who in the future will become ill from their previous
exposure to asbestos. Estimates suggest that roughly 60 companies
entangled in asbestos litigation have gone bankrupt primarily because
of asbestos liabilities, with most of the bankruptcies occurring since
1990. One study estimated that between 52,000 and 60,000 workers
were displaced because of these bankruptcies. Moreover, bankruptcy
results in a shrinking pool of money to be divided up among future
claimants. The growing number of bankruptcies raises concerns that
those who become ill in the future will receive little or no compensation.

Chapter 11

| 219

For other injuries, a possible approach to compensating accident victims
would be a system akin to workers’ compensation, in which compensation
would be provided by an insurance system. New Zealand has replaced the
personal injury and medical liability aspects of its tort system with a government-run compensation system. Such a system, however, can increase the
prevalence of accidents because fully-insured individuals may not take sufficient care against a loss. This is not a concern in cases where accidents have
already occurred, such as asbestos exposure. In other cases, such as product
liability or medical liability, the effect of changes in the system on the
behavior of potential victims is an important consideration. Moreover, like
the tort system, workers’ compensation systems tend to be costly to administer and may encourage frivolous claims. Replacing the tort system with a
more general workers’ compensation system could well mean replacing one
costly and inefficient system with another.

Avoiding the Tort System
Recontractualization is an alternative approach to reform that has been the
subject of considerable academic discussion. According to this idea, individuals and firms would be allowed to specify by contract the types of damages
for which injurers would be liable. For example, consumers or their insurers
could determine individual caps on damages in exchange for lower prices for
goods and services. In principle, potential defendants would enter into such
contracts if they reduced the expected costs of dealing with injuries. Such a
system would be voluntary, so that individuals could refuse to participate if
offered a contract by a potential defendant that was inferior to the insurance
associated with the tort system.
A possible drawback to this approach is that the courts currently view
contracts limiting damages or defining negligence with suspicion. Courts
have held that warranties that limit liability are not enforceable because they
are contracts of adhesion—agreements that the purchaser of a product or
service has no choice but to accept. Hence, it is likely that any steps toward
recontractualization would require substantial institutional and legal changes.
This could explain why this approach has not received much attention from
policy makers.

220 | Economic Report of the President

Conclusion
The tort system has expanded in the last 30 years. By expanding the
number of accidents for which accident victims receive compensation, the
current tort system in effect requires the suppliers of goods and services to
provide insurance to their customers. This tort-based insurance against accidents appears to be more expensive than other methods of compensating
victims. At least in the cases of product liability and medical liability, the
expansion of the tort system does not appear to have had an appreciable
effect in deterring negligent behavior.
The President has proposed several initiatives to reduce the burden of
torts on the economy. These include placing limits on noneconomic
damages, reforming class action procedures, and finding alternative methods
to compensate injuries such as those that have been proposed for people
suffering from asbestos-related ailments. These steps would focus the tort
system on those cases it can deal with most effectively and lessen the costs
to society of frivolous lawsuits and awards.

International Trade and Cooperation

S

ince the end of the Second World War, international trade has grown
steadily relative to overall economic activity. Countries that have been
more open to international flows of goods, services, and capital grew faster
than countries that were less open to the global economy. The United States
has been a driving force in constructing an open global trading system. A
series of international trade agreements has reduced barriers to trade in goods
and services and has been an important element in U.S. and global growth.
During this period, new types of trade emerged and delivered new benefits
to consumers and firms in trading countries. Growing international demand
for goods such as movies, pharmaceuticals, and recordings offered new opportunities for U.S. exporters. A burgeoning trade in services provided an
important outlet for U.S. expertise in sectors such as banking, engineering,
and higher education. The ability to buy goods and services from new places
has made household budgets go farther, while the ability of firms to distribute
their production around the globe has cut costs and thus prices to consumers.
The key points in this chapter are:
• Trade has grown significantly since World War II. The benefits from new
forms of trade, such as trade in services, are no different from the
benefits of traditional trade in goods.
• The benefits of integration are substantial.
• International cooperation is an essential part of realizing the potential
gains from international trade. A system through which countries can
resolve disputes can play an important role in realizing these gains.

Increased Trade Flows: Facts and Trends
One way to measure the relative importance of international trade is to
compare the value of trade flows to overall economic activity. In the latter half
of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first, growth in world trade has
outpaced growth in world output (Chart 12-1). As recently as 1950, the sum
of merchandise exports of all countries equaled only 8 percent of world GDP.
In 2002, the most recent year for which data are available, exports had
increased to 19 percent of world output. For the United States, the sum of
merchandise exports and imports rose from 7 percent to 18 percent of GDP
over the same period.
223

Increased trade has been accompanied by increased output growth, which
can be attributed, at least in part, to the opening of markets and to the benefits derived from the international trading system. The growth in world
trade also reflects lower transportation costs, which facilitate trade; new
production processes, which allow companies to produce and assemble
goods in different countries; and information technology, which facilitates
communication between buyers and sellers. These allow trading countries to
take advantage of variations in resource endowments and sectoral productivities across countries.
The United States is the largest importer and exporter of goods and
services in the world, although its prowess at exporting is sometimes less
apparent to the casual observer than the country’s demand for imports. This
is because many of the products that U.S. firms export are capital goods used
in production and are not sold at the retail level to consumers (Table 12-1).
The composition of U.S. exports reflects its abundance of skilled labor and
high-technology expertise relative to other countries. This relative abundance explains why the United States is more likely to export aircraft and
semiconductors and import footwear and clothing.
U.S. export levels depend partly on the vitality of export markets. When
U.S. trading partners such as Europe and Japan experience slow growth, as
has occurred in recent years, they import fewer goods from the United
States. The developed countries of North America, Europe, and Japan still
account for roughly two-thirds of world imports and exports of goods, and
over 70 percent of world trade in services.

The Benefits of Free Trade
The benefits of free trade are often misunderstood. Discussions of the
gains from trade often focus on the jobs created in industries that export
goods and services rather than the benefits to consumers and producers from
importing. The jobs created by exports are important—indeed, some
research suggests that workers in export industries tend to have higher wages
than those in other industries. The benefits of trade, however, are much
greater. In fact, the claim that free trade is good mainly because it allows us
to export misses much of the story. Free trade is good not just because it
allows us to export, but also because it allows us to import. Providing goods
and services to people in other countries is worthwhile because it allows
Americans to consume the goods and services made in other countries. This
is analogous to why most people work at their jobs—to earn the income
with which to buy goods and services. That is, people “export” the product
of their efforts and in return receive income with which to buy goods and
services made by other people.
The benefits of exports are similar. The advantage of selling goods and
services abroad is that U.S. exporters receive funds that can be spent on
imports for Americans to consume. Imports allow Americans to purchase
more varieties of goods and services at lower cost than if the same items were
obtained from domestic producers. These cost savings free up resources to
be used to produce other products. In this way, imports raise the standard of
living in the United States.

Chapter 12

| 225

Comparative Advantage
Free trade does not require that one country gains at another country’s
expense. Free trade is win-win. Just as the United States benefits from goods
produced more cheaply abroad, other countries benefit from goods built
more efficiently here. Each country gains from these exchanges because each
has different capabilities. Free trade encourages countries to specialize in
what they do best. Such a division of tasks raises economic well-being
around the world, just as the specialization of individual workers into
different jobs makes a company more productive.
Free trade also pushes American businesses to become as efficient as
possible by exposing them to competition from foreign firms. For example,
foreign competition over the past several decades has spurred improvements
on the part of U.S. automakers. American firms and workers responded to
the challenge of international competition by improving American cars and
making them less expensive. American consumers are better off as a result of
increased choice and better value.
Barriers to trade, in contrast, tend to help a relatively small number of
firms and their workers at the expense of harming a much larger number of
consumers who pay more for their goods as a result of protection. Each
consumer might pay only modestly more while the beneficiaries of the
protection gain substantially. The total financial costs of protection borne by
consumers, however, are typically larger than the benefits that accrue to
producers and workers.
The effects of trade policy on economic growth and the mechanisms by
which trade affects growth have been controversial. In part, this is because it
is difficult to disentangle the effects of trade liberalization on economic growth
from the effects of the multitude of other policies that countries adopt. As late
as the 1950s and 1960s, the idea that open markets spur economic growth was
somewhat unconventional. The more common belief was that developing
countries should close their borders to imports in order to support and
encourage the growth of their own firms. This approach became known as
“import substitution” because countries sought to develop home industries in
place of imports. This was believed to be particularly important for the manufacturing sector. Advocates of this view pointed to positive past experiences
with protection among currently developed countries. Developing countries
that followed this strategy and tried to substitute domestic production for
imports often found initial success, but subsequently encountered serious
economic difficulties.
Broad comparisons of countries’ experiences support the assessment that
openness to trade is significantly correlated with economic growth. One
study examined the experience of 133 countries from 1950 to 1998.
Countries’ annual real incomes per capita grew about 1⁄2 percentage point
226 | Economic Report of the President

faster after liberalizing trade policies than under their closed regimes.
Further, the income gains from opening up to free trade have become
increasingly significant; countries that removed trade barriers in the 1990s
raised their growth rates 21⁄2 percentage points, an additional 2 percentage
points per year. While the results of these cross-country studies are not
irrefutable, their findings are bolstered by studies of individual
countries’ problems with trade protection and successes with liberalization.

Assisting People and Communities
Affected by Free Trade
Although openness to trade provides substantial benefits to the Nation as
a whole, foreign competition can require adjustment on the part of some
individuals, businesses, and industries. To help workers affected by trade
develop the skills needed for new jobs, the Administration has built upon
and developed programs to assist workers and communities that are negatively affected by trade. The Administration has reformed existing programs
to make them more responsive and flexible. For example, the long-standing
Trade Adjustment Assistance program offered training and income support
to workers directly hurt by greater imports. This program was significantly
enhanced by new legislation signed by the President in 2002 to extend eligibility to workers indirectly affected, such as upstream suppliers of the firms
hurt by imports. The new legislation also expanded the benefits to include
a health insurance tax credit and a wage supplement for older workers who
found new jobs that did not pay as well as the jobs they had lost. This assistance, which will total $12 billion over 10 years, helps ease the adjustment
for displaced workers and helps them move into jobs where they are most
needed. In addition, the President has proposed a pilot program for Personal
Reemployment Accounts, which would offer an innovative approach to
worker adjustment. These accounts would provide unemployed individuals
funds they can use for training, for job-search assistance, or as a cash
reemployment bonus if they find new work quickly.
The creation and destruction of jobs is part of the way in which people and
materials move from less-productive to more-productive functions in a freemarket economy. Businesses fail and jobs are lost for many reasons; for
example, changes in technology or new domestic competition can shake up
industries and communities. In the 1980s, 70 percent of the changes in
employment in U.S. manufacturing resulted from less demand for relatively
low-skilled workers and greater demand for high-skilled workers within the
same industry. This indicates that the job losses in the 1980s were not primarily due to foreign trade pushing workers out of a sector, but to the changing
nature of manufacturing. Import competition, however, often receives a
Chapter 12

| 227

disproportionate share of the blame. This may be because there is less that can
be done to prevent the dislocations associated with technological change.

New Facets of Trade
The nature of U.S. trade has changed dramatically over the last several
decades. Whereas the United States once would have exported your father’s
Oldsmobile in exchange for foreign-made food or clothing, the United
States is now as likely to export financial or educational services, Hollywood
blockbusters, or life-saving medicines. The United States still imports food
and apparel, but it also imports components that go into sophisticated products (such as computer hard drives). This section explores several ways in
which modern trade has evolved from the classic exchange of manufactured
and agricultural goods.

Intellectual Property
The kinds of goods that have been traded for centuries, such as wine or
clothing, have two important attributes: the value of the good is linked to
the physical object, and it costs roughly the same to produce the second unit
of the good as the first. Many of the goods in which the United States now
excels—movies, books, music, software, and pharmaceuticals—are dramatically different from traditional goods. The value of a book, movie, or
computer software program lies in the ideas contained within, more than in
the paper and binding or disk. The cost of producing the first book includes
not just the paper and ink, but the intellectual contribution of the author.
To produce the second copy of the book, however, only the raw materials are
required, which makes it significantly less expensive. As discussed later in the
chapter, trade in goods with valuable intellectual property raises different
policy questions than does more-traditional trade.

Services
Services trade is growing in importance in the world economy (Chart 12-2).
The services sector, for trade purposes, includes travel and transportationrelated services, royalties and license fees, and other private services, such as
finance, insurance and telecommunications. The service-providing sector is the
largest component of the private economy in the United States, providing more
than 86 million jobs in 2003 and accounting for over half of total GDP. In
2002, the United States exported services worth almost $300 billion, about 30
percent of total exports of goods and services.
Worldwide services trade totaled $1.5 trillion in 2002, compared to goods
trade of over $6 trillion, but services trade has been growing faster. Unlike
228 | Economic Report of the President

goods trade, in which a product can be loaded on a ship at one port and
off-loaded anywhere in the world with little need for the exporter and
importer to interact, services trade generally requires extensive interaction.
Some services can be provided at a distance, such as software services. For
others, such as tourism, the customer must come to the location of the
service provider. For others, such as some consulting work, the service
provider must come to the customer. The liberalization of services trade
involves the movement of individuals as well as the regulation of investment
and other business activity. For American banks to sell many of their services abroad, they must open branches in their target markets (Box 12-1). As
a result, negotiations to liberalize trade in services have moved beyond
border measures such as tariffs (taxes on imports) to deal with subjects that
have traditionally been the domain of domestic regulation.
One facet of increased services trade is the increased use of offshore
outsourcing in which a company relocates labor-intensive service industry
functions to another country. For example, a U.S. firm might use a callcenter in India to handle customer service-related questions. The principal
novelty of outsourcing services is the means by which foreign purchases are
delivered. Whereas imported goods might arrive by ship, outsourced services
are often delivered using telephone lines or the Internet. The basic economic
forces behind the transactions are the same, however. When a good or
service is produced more cheaply abroad, it makes more sense to import it
than to make or provide it domestically.
Chapter 12

| 229

Box 12-1: Trade in Financial Services
The United States is the world's top producer and exporter of financial services, with exports of roughly $16 billion in 2002. Foreign
clients rely on U.S. firms for financial advice, fund management,
credit-card services, credit-rating services, and housing finance. In
developing countries that suffer from a shortage of capital or qualified
human resources, foreign-provided services can offer vital support for
economic development. Financial services can introduce new technologies, promote better business practices, and provide access to
the global capital market.
The experience of foreign financial services firms in Mexico provides
an example of the benefits of trade in financial services. In the aftermath of the peso devaluation in 1994, thousands of business went
bankrupt. As a result, a number of Mexican banks failed and the government was forced to purchase $100 billion worth of nonperforming loans
to prevent a systemic banking crisis. The Mexican government also
encouraged foreign banks to invest in Mexican banks. The government
hoped that foreign banks would inject much-needed liquidity into the
financial system. U.S. and other foreign financial service companies are
credited with helping to stabilize Mexico’s financial sector. Together,
foreign firms now manage a significant fraction of the assets of the
Mexican banking system.

Intra-industry Trade and Intermediate Products
In classical descriptions of trade, a country with abundant land sends corn
to a country with abundant capital in exchange for automobiles. In modern
trade, it is common for two countries to send machine tools back and forth
to each other. While the items traveling in both directions might all be
machine tools, they are distinct products that draw on similar production
capabilities. Even when a country is technologically capable of producing all
varieties of a product, it is cost-effective to specialize in producing particular
varieties and then trade with partner countries to obtain other types of the
product. This type of trade is referred to as intra-industry trade.
Modern trade also differs from classical trade because the production of
any given product may be spread across several countries. Final assembly
might occur in the United States, for example, using parts (intermediate
inputs) that were built in Canada and Brazil. In fact, a good deal of U.S.
trade involves flows of intermediate inputs used for domestic production.
230 | Economic Report of the President

This kind of trade can have very different economic effects. In the
conventional trade model, an increase in imports would drive out domestic
production and jobs in the import-competing sectors. Evidence indicates,
however, that increases in imports are correlated with increases in domestic
employment in the same product category. One explanation for this result
is that when production is integrated across countries, an increase in
demand can stimulate both domestic and foreign production.

International Cooperation and Disputes
Countries can benefit from cooperation that increases trade. This has
always been true for the shipment of goods across borders, but it is even
more essential for the new types of trade described above. Trade in services
and goods with high intellectual-property content often requires a deeper
involvement on the part of the exporter in the importing country, as in the
case of U.S. bank branches overseas.

Why Is There a Need for Cooperation?
Even if a nation understands and accepts the benefits of importing, there
may still be an incentive to intervene in trade through policies such as tariffs.
Countries that are large enough to affect world prices can potentially benefit
by limiting their demand for imports and moving the terms of trade (the relative price of exports to imports) in their favor. If two large countries try to
do this to each other, however, they can make their situations worse than
under free trade.
One reminder of this lesson was the aftermath of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff
Act of 1930. Though the United States had a trade surplus before 1930, the
pressures of the nascent Great Depression led Congress to raise tariffs in an
ill-conceived attempt to protect American jobs. Trading partners around the
world responded by raising their own trade barriers. This was an important
factor in the ensuing breakdown of international commerce, contributing to
lower employment worldwide.
Many of the post-World War II international economic institutions
established under U.S. leadership, such as the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund, were responses to perceived failures in international economic policy in the prewar period. The plan under which these
two institutions were created also included a proposal for an organization,
the International Trade Organization (ITO), to oversee cooperation in
international trade. The ITO was never established due to political disputes.
For more than four decades the trading system was governed instead by a
series of agreements known as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
Chapter 12

| 231

(GATT). GATT only became part of a formal organization, the World Trade
Organization (WTO), in 1995. Despite the absence of a standing international body, substantial progress was made in global trade liberalization.
In the first GATT negotiations in the late 1940s, a relatively small group
of countries, including the United States, looked for opportunities in which
they could all benefit from reciprocally lowering barriers. This gathering to
seek mutual gains from cooperation was known as a “round.” The current
multilateral trade talks were launched by well over 100 countries in Doha,
Qatar, in 2001.
Early trade talks were primarily devoted to cutting tariffs. This era of
import liberalization coincided with and contributed to an era of rapid
worldwide economic growth. While tariff cuts could be painful for industries that faced new competition from imports, the United States gained
better market access for exports, while consumers and firms benefited from
lower prices of imports. At a practical level, tariff cutting was relatively easy.
If the United States and France each had 40 percent tariffs in sensitive
sectors, they could agree to cut those tariffs to 20 percent. Because of this
simplicity, as well as the limited number of participating countries, the early
GATT trade rounds were brief. Over time, however, GATT negotiations
became more comprehensive and more complex. The negotiations were held
less frequently and lasted much longer. Nonetheless, a good deal of progress
was made in liberalizing world trade. Among developed countries, successive
tariff cuts on manufactured goods lowered average tariff levels to below
5 percent. Barriers remained higher in developing countries.
Nontariff barriers to trade remain, but they are often more difficult to
address. For example, countries’ policies on protecting intellectual property
can constitute a nontariff barrier with important trade consequences (Box
12-2). Other types of regulations could, if misused, also constitute a barrier
to trade. For example, “sanitary and phytosanitary regulations” are rules
designed to protect the health of people, plants, and animals. A foreign
government seeking to block competition in a sensitive agricultural sector
could seek to ban imports on the basis of a product-safety claim that is
without a sound basis in science. The standard that was agreed upon in the
Uruguay Round of trade talks in 1994 was that such claims must be based
on sound scientific evidence. What constitutes such evidence has been the
subject of dispute. This circumstance poses a challenge: trade restrictions
based on sound science must be allowed and claims not founded on sound
science must be avoided or dismissed, but determining the difference is
frequently not an easy process.

232 | Economic Report of the President

Box 12-2: International Cooperation on Intellectual Property
Rights
The protection of intellectual property is an important new trade
issue. The United States has worked to ensure that copyrights, trademarks, and patents given to authors, companies, programmers, or
other inventors are protected in other countries.
One implication of the high development and low production costs of
goods with high intellectual property content is that they are relatively
easy to steal. While it may cost $80 million to create a feature film, the
blank videotape or DVD used to copy that film may cost just a few
dollars. It is a fairly straightforward matter for the United States to
prevent other countries from taking U.S. wheat without paying. It is
more difficult to prevent an exported copy of a movie, recording, or drug
from being reproduced, though the loss to the United States in forgone
exports would be just as significant. These losses can occur not only
through unauthorized duplication, but also through foreign government
policies such as controls on drug prices. These price controls reduce the
return that U.S. producers can earn from abroad and shift the burden of
paying for development costs to the American consumer.
As trade in goods embodying valuable intellectual property has
grown, the protection of intellectual property has emerged as an
important policy concern. In the Uruguay Round of trade talks, which
concluded in 1994, participating countries agreed to adopt high standards of intellectual property protection in the accord on
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Some
have misconstrued it as preventing developing nations from
addressing health emergencies such as the spread of AIDS in Africa.
At Doha in 2001, WTO members agreed that the TRIPS Agreement
does not and should not prevent members from taking measures to
protect public health. Furthermore, in 2003, the United States and
other WTO members agreed that developing countries that lack
domestic manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sectors
should be able to override patent rights to import needed medicines
from abroad in order to deal with domestic health problems.
The Administration has actively pursued measures in trade agreements to ensure the security of U.S. intellectual property rights. The
inclusion of these measures in trade agreements illustrates a new way
in which international cooperation benefits the United States. If countries are found to be in violation of their obligations under a trade
agreement, the United States could retaliate against those countries
across the entire range of transactions covered by the agreement.

Chapter 12

| 233

The Benefits of Dispute Settlement
Another issue that arises with international cooperation in trade is the
need for some way of solving disagreements among trading partners.
Disputes might occur when one country disregards a commitment it made
in negotiations, or when there is a disagreement over the interpretation of
an agreement.
If one WTO member has a complaint about the behavior of another
member, there is an established process for addressing the concern. First, the
two countries are required to consult and determine whether the dispute can
be resolved amicably. If this is not possible, a dispute settlement panel is
established at the WTO. This panel consists of experts, generally selected
from countries not involved in the dispute, who hear evidence from the
complaining and responding countries and then issue findings. The panel
determines whether a country has failed to follow through on commitments
previously made in its trade agreements. Panel findings can be appealed to a
standing body, which issues its own report and findings on the issues on
appeal. Panel and Appellate Body reports are then submitted to the Dispute
Settlement Body (DSB), also a standing body, for adoption. Once adopted,
these findings become DSB recommendations and rulings.
After the conclusion of the dispute process, the difference between the
WTO system and the domestic legal system becomes apparent. All WTO
members have agreed that when a country loses a dispute settlement case at
the WTO, the first preference is to bring the domestic law into compliance
with the DSB recommendations and rulings. However, if the losing country
chooses to maintain its initial policies, it must either negotiate compensation to the complaining country or else the complaining country can get
authorization from the WTO to retaliate by withdrawing concessions of
comparable value. If the latter happens, the net effect is the unwinding of
the reciprocal liberalization that the countries had undertaken.
The virtue of an orderly dispute-settlement system that has the confidence
of all participants is that the unraveling of cooperation is limited. Parties not
involved in the dispute handle the facts and interpretation of the dispute,
reducing the scope for disagreement over whether retaliation is legitimate.
The United States has had much success in complaints it has initiated
against other countries’ trade practices. As of September 2003, the United
States had filed 63 complaints against other countries. Of the 39 that have
been resolved through panel proceedings, the United States lost only 3 in
litigation. In turn, the United States was a respondent in 77 cases over the
same time period and successfully defended its practices in 4 of the resulting
38 panel proceedings. These statistics suggest that WTO complaints are not
brought frivolously, in the sense that complaints, whether by or against the
United States, have a high probability of success.
234 | Economic Report of the President

An effective dispute-settlement mechanism that has the confidence of all
participants is an important part of the cooperative trading system. A
dispute-settlement system can help to ensure that all parties to trade
agreements receive the benefits on which they agreed.

Progress Toward Free Trade
The United States has pursued trade liberalization through negotiations at
the global, regional, and bilateral levels. This multipronged approach allows
for continuing progress even when one avenue for liberalization is blocked
or stalled. Due to its global reach, the broadest and most important forum
for liberalization is the World Trade Organization. This body now has
148 members. Among the central principles of the WTO is the requirement
that the lowest tariff offered to one WTO member must be offered to all
members. This principle, known as most-favored-nation (MFN) treatment,
ensures that even if cooperative agreements are reached among a smaller
group of countries, those countries will extend the benefits broadly to other
WTO members. Although WTO rules permit important exceptions to the
MFN principle, such as allowing countries to lower barriers with tradeagreement partners and as part of trade preference programs for poor
countries, when the MFN principle is observed it creates a “level playing
field” of equal tariffs on all trading partners so that countries will buy goods
from the most-efficient producer.
The WTO encompasses agreements made under the GATT, as well as
agreements on trade in services, intellectual property, and other issues. The
WTO is driven by its members. It does not serve as a legislative body and
passes no laws. What the WTO provides is a forum for countries to come
together to negotiate. When there are decisions to be made, they are reached
by consensus of the members rather than by majority vote. The principal
task of the WTO Secretariat is to support the work of member countries as
they pursue the goal of trade liberalization.
The Administration played a critical role in launching the Doha
Development Agenda negotiations in 2001, following the failure of the 1999
Seattle ministerial meeting to initiate new multilateral trade negotiations.
Participating nations agreed that the negotiations would focus on the needs
of developing countries and their integration into the global trading system.
The United States has put forward proposals for liberalization of trade in
agriculture, consumer and industrial goods, and services—the three major
areas for market access under negotiation. The Administration is committed
to a successful completion of the Doha Development Agenda. This would
substantially lower barriers to trade in all countries and provide expanded
Chapter 12

| 235

market access for American goods and services, while boosting economic
prospects for developing countries. One study estimates that removal of tariff
barriers, production subsidies, and export subsidies could raise annual world
income by over $355 billion by 2015. According to another study, a
successful round that lowered trade barriers around the world could raise the
level of U.S. GDP by $144 billion each year, which translates into additional
annual income of $2,000 or more for a family of four.
The WTO operates by consensus, so it takes little to halt progress. While
the Administration seeks to continue work on global trade negotiations
through the WTO, it has also independently pursued trade liberalization
with developed and developing nations through far-reaching bilateral and
regional agreements (Table 12-2). These free trade agreements (FTAs)
remove substantially all barriers to trade between participants and allow for
cooperation in other areas of concern, such as regulation of investments and
the protection of intellectual property, the environment, and labor rights.
Under WTO rules, countries may undertake preferential liberalization in a
free trade agreement, as long as the accord is comprehensive and the
liberalization is completed in a reasonable period of time.

236 | Economic Report of the President

For each potential trading partner in a free trade agreement, the United
States assesses the economic benefits such an agreement would bring to the
United States, the extent to which the country is ready to undertake free
trade obligations, and the role that the agreement would play in furthering
the broader, worldwide trade-liberalization agenda. Throughout the process
of selecting and negotiating with FTA partners, the Administration consults
with members of Congress, public-interest groups, and industry representatives. The United States has demonstrated its willingness to liberalize trade
with countries from around the world, both developing and developed.
These agreements offer the benefits of trade and investment to the United
States and our partner countries and help build a coalition of nations
interested in achieving progress in multilateral talks.
The United States has worked to rapidly expand its set of FTA partners,
while maintaining low trade barriers to goods and services from all countries
through our global commitments.

Conclusion
The United States has benefited and continues to benefit enormously
from the international exchange of goods and services. Trade allows countries to specialize in those activities that make the best use of their skills and
resources, as well as to reap the benefits in terms of imported goods. These
gains have increased as lower barriers, better transportation, and easier
communication have expanded existing international markets and created
new ones.
Another important but often overlooked benefit to the expansion of free
trade is the expansion of freedom and democracy. Involvement in the global
economy provides incentives for nations to ensure a degree of transparency
and stability in order to attract investors and trading partners. It also encourages countries to embrace a more democratic and less corrupt system of
government. Economic freedoms can lead to greater political freedoms.
As the complexity of international trade has increased, so too has the
complexity of the agreements that govern it. The dispute-settlement mechanism in the WTO has been useful for resolving disagreements between
WTO members. The United States has been challenged on certain trade
practices, but in turn has used the dispute settlement system to assert its
rights and challenge the practices of other countries.
The Administration is committed to an open and unfettered trading system
to promote economic growth in the United States and around the world.

International Capital Flows

I

nternational capital flows are the transfer of financial assets, such as cash,
stocks, or bonds, across international borders. They have become an
increasingly significant part of the world economy over the past decade and
an important source of funds to support investment in the United States. In
2002, around $700 billion flowed into the United States. Inflows of international capital help to finance U.S. factories, support U.S. medical research,
and fund U.S. companies. At the same time, U.S. investors provided nearly
$200 billion in capital to other countries for a wide range of purposes.
Around $2 trillion flowed into countries around the world in 2002,
equivalent to roughly 6 percent of global GDP (Chart 13-1). Although these
world capital flows have dropped from a peak of over 13 percent of GDP in
2000, largely reflecting a global economic slowdown, they remain above the
level of the early 1990s.

239

This chapter describes the various types of international capital flows and
discusses their benefits, as well as their risks. The key points in this chapter are:
• Capital flows have significant potential benefits for economies around
the world.
• Countries with sound macroeconomic policies and well-functioning
institutions are in the best position to reap the benefits of capital flows
and minimize the risks.
• Countries that permit free capital flows must choose between the
stability provided by fixed exchange rates and the flexibility afforded by
an independent monetary policy.

Types of International Capital Flows
Not all capital flows are alike, and there is evidence that the motivation
for capital flows and their impact vary by the type of investment. Capital
flows can be grouped into three broad categories: foreign direct investment,
portfolio investment, and bank and other investment (Chart 13-2).

240 | Economic Report of the President

Foreign Direct Investment
Foreign direct investment occurs when an investor, in many cases a firm
rather than an individual, gains some control over the functioning of an
enterprise in another country. This typically takes place through a direct
purchase of a business enterprise or when the purchaser acquires more than
10 percent of the shares of the target asset.
A number of factors affect the flow of foreign direct investment. Trade
links between investor and recipient countries tend to increase foreign direct
investment, as demonstrated by the establishment of Japanese auto plants in
the United States starting in the 1980s. Proximity to foreign markets also
plays a role, as shown by the investment of U.S. companies in China to
service Chinese consumers and firms. The political, economic, and legal
stability of the recipient country also matters. Investors are reluctant to
establish ownership of foreign companies or set up businesses abroad if
corruption or political or social instability are likely to jeopardize operations.
In 2002, foreign direct investment made up roughly one quarter of world
capital inflows. About 40 percent of these flows went to the major industrial
countries—the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Japan, and
countries in the euro zone. During much of the 1990s, the United States was
the largest single recipient of foreign direct investment. Foreign direct investment flows to industrialized countries are driven largely by the desire for better
distribution networks and market access. Another 30 percent of total foreign
direct investment went to emerging markets. Relative to flows to industrial
countries, these investments were driven more by the low production costs
and growing markets of Asia, as well as the privatization of state-owned
enterprises in many countries in Latin America and Eastern Europe.

Portfolio Investment
Portfolio investment occurs when investors purchase noncontrolling
interests in foreign companies or buy foreign corporate or government
bonds, short-term securities, or notes. This type of investment accounted for
almost half of world capital inflows in 2002.
Economic and financial conditions in the recipient and investor countries
are important influences on portfolio investment flows. The market for these
assets is typically more liquid than that for direct investments; it is usually
easier to sell a stock or bond than a factory. As a result, investors can quickly
reshuffle portfolio investments if they lose confidence in their purchases. Not
surprisingly, portfolio investment is far more volatile than foreign direct
investment. Countries that receive large capital inflows in one year can see a
quick reversal of these inflows if economic or political developments cause
investors to reevaluate the expected return on their assets.
Chapter 13

| 241

Sudden and destabilizing reversals of portfolio investment took place in
countries such as Korea, Mexico, Russia, Brazil, and Argentina during the
second half of the 1990s and early 2000s. These reversals partly reflected the
concern that private-sector and government borrowers in emerging market
economies might be unable to meet their financial obligations.
In the United States, portfolio investment in U.S. government securities
has played an increasingly important role since 2001. Foreign purchases of
U.S. government securities rose from 3 percent of total capital inflows in
2001 to 33 percent in the first three quarters of 2003. One of the most
important factors explaining this change is a shift in the share of U.S. security purchases by foreign investors from equities into lower-risk assets, such
as U.S. government obligations. Another important factor is increased
purchases of U.S. government securities by foreign central banks. A decline
in the number of mergers and acquisitions in the United States has also led
to lower foreign purchases of private assets.

Bank Investment
Bank investment is the third major type of capital flow. Bank-related
international investment includes deposit holdings by foreigners and loans
to foreign individuals, businesses, and governments. These investments,
grouped with a few other miscellaneous types of investments, accounted for
over one quarter of total international capital inflows in 2002. For emerging
markets, the importance of these bank-related and other investment flows
has declined dramatically in the past decade. While these flows represented
an average of 28 percent of capital inflows to emerging economies from
1992 to 1996, they represented an average of only 3 percent of inflows from
1997 to 2002. Economic crises in a number of Asian and Latin American
countries since the mid-1990s have contributed to reduced bank lending to
these regions since 1997, notably from banks in Japan and Europe.

Benefits of International Capital Flows
Capital flows can have a number of important benefits:
• International capital allows countries to finance more investment than
can be supported by domestic saving, thereby increasing output and
employment.
• Greater access to foreign markets can provide new opportunities for
foreign and domestic investors to increase the return and reduce the
risk of their portfolios.

242 | Economic Report of the President

• Foreign direct investment can facilitate the transfer of technology
and managerial expertise to developing countries, thus improving
productivity.
• Better risk management and other management techniques associated
with foreign direct investment can help recipients modify their
production processes to lower costs and raise productivity.
• Exposure to international capital markets and the resulting increased
competition may induce governments and firms issuing assets to
improve macroeconomic policy, management, and profitability. These
improvements may, in turn, encourage additional foreign investment.
• Improved international access to investment opportunities in the
country receiving capital inflows expands the number of potential
investors in any domestic project. This will tend to reduce the cost of
raising capital.
• Increased capital inflows can spur the development of domestic
financial sectors. A well-developed financial sector can lead to greater
investment and reduced financial-sector vulnerability.
Empirical evidence suggests that countries that are open to capital flows
can enjoy many of these benefits. In the case of foreign direct investment,
studies indicate that industries and some developing countries with more
foreign direct investment grow faster than those with less foreign direct
investment. In addition, extensive research has found that foreign-owned
firms tend to have higher productivity and wages than do their domestic
counterparts. Finally, for some developing countries, foreign direct investment can help catalyze the adoption of more-advanced technologies and
management practices.
Foreign portfolio investment has played a key role in furthering the
development of domestic equity and bond markets. In the case of equity
markets, one report estimates that opening up to foreign shareholders leads
to an almost 40 percent increase in the real dollar value of the stock market.
This lowers the cost of equity capital for domestic firms, as a higher stock
price means that a smaller portion of a company needs to be sold to raise a
given amount of capital. Developing equity markets can help restrain the
ability of corporate managers to pursue their own goals and can help align
managerial incentives with earnings growth. In the case of debt markets,
evidence indicates that foreign investment can widen the investor base and
help businesses raise capital. Moreover, developing countries that lack debt
markets may rely excessively on bank lending. Studies suggest that this may
leave economies more vulnerable to financial crises because banks are less
likely to hold well-diversified portfolios than are participants in developed
bond markets.

Chapter 13

| 243

For all of these reasons, financial market liberalization has been linked to
greater investment and higher output growth. One study found that equity
market liberalization raised annual economic growth by about 1 percentage
point per year in the five years following liberalization. In a related study, the
same researchers showed that 17 out of a set of 21 countries that opened
their equity markets to foreign participation experienced faster averagegrowth rates than before liberalization.
A foreign banking presence can also have substantial benefits for the host
economy. Foreign-owned financial institutions have been shown to improve
the standards and efficiency of the domestic banking sector. This can raise
the net yield on saving and enhance capital accumulation and growth. In
Latin America, studies have shown that foreign banks in the latter half of the
1990s had higher and less-volatile loan growth than the average domestic
bank. Foreign banks may also be a stabilizing force during periods of financial stress. This is partly because foreign banks are often better capitalized
and have access to financing through their parent companies at times when
domestic banks might be unable to raise capital. Because foreign banks are
often better managed and less exposed to domestic downturns, they can also
provide citizens some insurance against a collapse of the domestic banking
sector. Drawing on the experiences of the Asian crises, academic work
suggests that the greater the foreign bank presence in a developing country,
the less likely the country was to experience a banking crisis. The ability to
hold bank accounts in other countries and borrow from overseas financial
institutions can also facilitate trade.

Risks of International Capital Flows
Many countries that reduced barriers to capital flows in the 1990s experienced
large capital inflows, increased investment, and strong growth. Several of
these countries, however, subsequently experienced economic crises. In the
majority of these crises, capital outflows were associated with currency
depreciations. The governments, firms, and citizens of many of these
emerging markets had significant amounts of debt denominated in foreign
currency but received income denominated in domestic currency. The
currency depreciations therefore greatly impaired the capacity of these
borrowers to service their debts. The resulting increase in bankruptcies and,
in some cases, government defaults, weakened the banking sectors and other
financial institutions in these countries. All of these factors contributed to
sharp contractions in output and high unemployment rates. Such “currency
crises” occurred in Mexico, Thailand, Korea, Russia, and Argentina from the
mid-1990s through 2001. These experiences have led to a more guarded
view of the advantages of capital flows.
244 | Economic Report of the President

One lesson learned from these crises is that a strong institutional framework
is important if a country is to benefit fully from openness to capital flows. In
other words, capital flows are more likely to yield substantial benefits and carry
fewer risks in countries where the financial system is strong and well developed; laws and regulations are clear, reasonable, and enforced by the courts
and public institutions; and the reporting of financial information is timely
and accurate so that investors have a clear understanding of the conditions and
strength of the assets in which they are investing. Corruption is also associated
with lower foreign investment and weaker growth.
In countries with weak institutions or high levels of corruption, capital
inflows may not be channeled to their most-productive uses, dissipating
their potential benefits. In these cases, improved access to capital can allow
firms and sovereigns to accumulate high levels of debt through purchases of
unproductive assets. This can ultimately leave firms and countries vulnerable
to changes in investor sentiment, possibly contributing to economic crises.
One approach to limiting these risks when legal and financial institutions
are poorly developed is to restrict foreign capital flows. Experience, however,
suggests that capital controls impose substantial costs. Controls on the
movement of capital can distort firms’ investment decisions, increase opportunities for corruption, and discourage foreign direct investment. All of
these effects can depress growth (Box 13-1).

Box 13-1: Capital Controls in Emerging Markets
Recent economic crises in several emerging economies that
opened their markets to capital flows have renewed debate on the
desirability of capital controls. Any benefits of restrictions on capital
flows, however, must be weighed against the costs and distortions
they impose.
Capital controls can take various forms and can target either capital
inflows or capital outflows. Countries may adopt controls on capital
inflows in an attempt to prevent an appreciation of their currency or
to direct foreign investments to longer-term ventures. Experience
shows that these controls, regardless of whether they achieve their
objective, can create problems, including economic distortions and
large administrative fees. For example, in the 1990s, the Chilean
government required that a portion of capital inflows be temporarily
deposited in a non-interest-bearing central bank account. These
restrictions lowered the risk of rapid capital flight, and some analyses
show that they lengthened the average period of time that capital
inflows remained in Chile. These restrictions, however, also increased
administrative costs, especially because the government had to

Chapter 13

| 245

Box 13-1 — continued
modify them frequently to close numerous loopholes. Research also
shows that these controls on capital inflows caused smaller, public
firms to face greater financing constraints than they did before
the restrictions. These higher financing costs may have stifled an
important source of growth and innovation in Chile.
Countries’ experiences with controls on capital outflows reinforce
the view that controls are difficult to implement and often carry unexpected costs. Controls on capital outflows also take a variety of
forms, such as limitations on the amount of domestic holdings of
foreign currency and restrictions on the ability of foreign investors to
repatriate their earnings. The potential to avert financial crises triggered by capital outflows can make controls appealing in theory. In
practice, however, any such benefits tend to be eroded over time as
firms and individuals find ways to circumvent the restrictions. Such
evasive activity can create additional problems, such as reduced
financial transparency and tax compliance, distortions from the
unequal impact of the controls (as not all sectors have equal access to
the evasive measures), and a general reduction in respect for the law.
For example, studies indicate that controls on capital outflows in
Russia in the mid-1990s were evaded by exporters, particularly in the
energy sector, through the underreporting of earnings.
Finally, capital controls can also distort the behavior of foreign
investors. For example, research indicates that American multinational firms invest less in their local affiliates in countries with capital
controls. In addition, multinationals tend to alter their investment and
payment structure in order to minimize the effect of the restrictions.
This distortion is yet another way capital controls can reduce the
productivity of the world’s stock of capital.

Another approach for developing countries to minimize the risks from
opening up to capital movements involves the careful timing, or sequencing,
of policies designed to “liberalize” financial markets. One variant of this
approach suggests that countries should first achieve macroeconomic
stability, in part by implementing sound fiscal and monetary policies.
Countries should next strengthen financial market institutions, and only
then allow for free capital flows. While this approach may work for some
countries under specific economic conditions, the pace and timing of
reforms appear to be less important than the consistency of the reforms and
the government’s commitment to them.

246 | Economic Report of the President

Policy makers increasingly realize that there is no simple rule to best
achieve free capital flows, and that country characteristics should be
considered. There is some consensus, however, that the benefits of international capital mobility can be substantial and that to best achieve these
benefits, countries should implement reforms of domestic financial and
legal institutions.

Constraints Imposed by Free Capital Flows
One consequence of allowing capital to flow freely in and out of a country
is that this constrains a nation’s choice of monetary policy and exchange-rate
regime. For important but subtle reasons related to the tendency for capital
to flow to where returns are the highest, countries can maintain only two of
the following three policies—free capital flows, a fixed exchange rate, and an
independent monetary policy. Economists refer to this restriction as the
impossible trinity. As illustrated by Chart 13-3, countries must choose to be
on one side of the triangle, adopting the policies at each end, but forgoing
the policy on the opposite corner.

Chapter 13

| 247

The easiest way to understand this restriction is through specific
examples. The United States allows free capital flows and has an independent monetary policy, but it has a flexible exchange rate. (The U.S.
government does not attempt to fix, or “peg,” the exchange value of the
dollar at any particular level against other currencies.) As a simplified
example, if the Federal Reserve Board raised its target interest rate relative to
foreign interest rates, capital would flow into the United States. By
increasing the demand for U.S. dollars relative to other currencies, these
capital inflows would increase the price of the dollar against other currencies. This would cause the exchange rate to adjust and the U.S. dollar to
appreciate. In the opposite case, if the Federal Reserve Board lowered its
target interest rate, net capital outflows would reduce the demand for
dollars, thereby causing the dollar to depreciate against foreign currencies.
In contrast, Hong Kong essentially pegs the value of its currency to the
U.S. dollar and allows free capital flows. (Hong Kong is a Special
Administrative Region of China, but maintains its own currency.) The
trade-off is that Hong Kong loses the ability to use monetary policy to influence domestic interest rates. Unlike the United States, Hong Kong cannot
cut interest rates to stimulate a weak economy. If Hong Kong’s interest rates
were to deviate from world rates, capital would flow in or out of the Hong
Kong economy, just as in the U.S. case above. Under a flexible exchange
rate, these flows would cause the price of the Hong Kong dollar to change
relative to that of other currencies. Under a fixed exchange rate, however, the
monetary authority must offset these flows by purchasing domestic or
foreign currency in order to keep the supply and demand for its currency
fixed, and therefore the exchange rate unchanged. The capacity of the
government to sustain large purchases and sales of its currency is ultimately
limited by several factors, including the amount of foreign exchange reserves
held by the government and its willingness to accumulate stocks of relatively
low-return foreign currency assets.
Just as in the case of Hong Kong, China pegs its exchange rate to the U.S.
dollar. China can operate an independent monetary policy, however, as it
maintains restrictions on capital flows. In China’s case, world and domestic
interest rates can differ, because controls on the transfer of funds in and out
of the country limit the resulting changes in the money supply and the
corresponding pressures on the exchange rate.
As these three examples show, if a country chooses to allow capital to flow
freely, it must also decide between having an independent monetary policy
or a fixed exchange rate. Many factors affect how a country makes this
crucial decision (Box 13-2).

248 | Economic Report of the President

Box 13-2: Choosing Among a Fixed Exchange Rate,
Independent Monetary Policy, and Free Capital Movements
How does a country choose whether to give up a fixed exchange
rate, independent monetary policy, or free capital movements? While
country-specific factors play a role, experience has shown that these
decisions also reflect global trends.
In the late 1920s, many countries, including the United States,
adopted an exchange-rate system in which they pegged their currencies
to a fixed quantity of gold. This system, which was used previously but
was abandoned during World War I, was known as the gold standard. It
effectively fixed the exchange rates of the currencies for all participating
countries. Countries generally coupled this fixed exchange rate with the
free movement of capital, relinquishing the ability to influence economic
activity at home through the use of independent monetary policy.
This system proved sustainable until the Great Depression of the
1930s, when many governments abandoned exchange-rate stability in
order to expand domestic demand by increasing the money supply and
lowering interest rates. Following the economic recoveries under this
regime, the choice of free capital flows and independent monetary
policy remained popular through the end of World War II.
The postwar era, however, saw substantial international integration
of markets and increasing cross-border trade. Countries such as the
United States wanted to facilitate this increase in trade by eliminating
the risks of exchange-rate fluctuations. At a summit held in Bretton
Woods, New Hampshire, in 1944, representatives from the major
industrial economies designed and implemented a plan that encouraged exchange-rate stability while maintaining autonomous monetary
policies. The Bretton Woods system, as it became known, offered countries greater monetary independence while fixing the value of the
dollar, yen, deutsche mark, and other currencies. Just as with the
previous systems, however, something had to be sacrificed—the
Bretton Woods arrangement required capital controls. Capital controls
included caps on the interest rates that banks could offer to depositors
and limitations on the types of assets in which banks could invest.
Further, governments frequently intervened in financial markets to
direct capital toward strategic domestic sectors. Though none of these
controls alone prevented international capital flows, in combination
they allowed governments to restrain the amount of cross-border
capital transactions.

Chapter 13

| 249

Box 13-2 — continued
In the early 1970s, the Bretton Woods system gave way to a morediverse set of regimes. Ultimately, as growth in other countries
outstripped growth in the United States, demand shifted from the U.S.
dollar to foreign currencies, putting downward pressure on the dollar’s
value. After several negotiated devaluations of the dollar, governments
agreed to abandon the system rather than continue to be forced to
change domestic interest and inflation rates to keep the dollar’s value
constant. Furthermore, greater financial sophistication and increasing
capital mobility made it more difficult and costly to sustain capital
controls in the advanced economies.
Since the end of the Bretton Woods system, countries have chosen
a variety of exchange-rate regimes. Countries in the euro zone, for
instance, have adopted the euro as a common currency. This is equivalent to fixing the exchange rates among the participating countries.
The euro, however, is allowed to move freely against other currencies
such as the dollar. Each of the countries within the euro zone has had
to give up its own independent monetary policy. The value of the U.S.
dollar, on the other hand, floats freely against other currencies. The
free movement of capital has been uniformly embraced by the
advanced industrial economies and is increasingly being adopted by
developing economies.

Encouraging Free Capital Flows
The Administration supports the free flow of capital between the United
States and other countries and encourages countries to take steps to open
their markets to international investment. Such efforts include the negotiation of Bilateral Investment Treaties, as well as Trade and Investment
Framework Agreements. Under these agreements, foreign countries commit
to treating U.S. investors fairly and to allowing U.S. corporations to operate
in foreign countries in closer accordance with standard U.S. practices and
procedures. This protection reduces the risks associated with investing
abroad and encourages U.S. multinational companies to expand through
foreign direct investment.
Investment measures and protections have also played a central role in free
trade agreements negotiated by the United States (these are discussed in
Chapter 12, International Trade and Cooperation). Recent trade agreements,
such as that with Chile, have included investment provisions that protect
American investors and ensure their access to foreign investment opportunities.
250 | Economic Report of the President

The United States also encourages countries to undertake the reforms that
will help them best reap the benefits of greater investment and capital flows.
These reforms include improvements in corporate governance and the
distribution of accurate, timely, and complete information on economic
conditions, government regulations, and corporate performance. The
Administration has focused on reducing the risks of destabilizing capital
flows in a number of ways.
One important development in this regard has been the increased inclusion
of “collective action clauses” in international bonds issued by emerging market
countries—a practice that has been supported and encouraged by the United
States. These clauses allow a majority of creditors to bind a minority to key
financial terms in the event of a debt restructuring. They also help facilitate
ongoing discussions and negotiations between a sovereign and its creditors. By
making it easier for issuers and bondholders to agree to changes in bond terms
in the event of a default or restructuring, collective action clauses provide a
contractual method for improving the resolution of situations where sovereign
debt levels are unsustainable. Such improvements to the debt-resolution
process should reduce the unnecessary loss of value to creditors and thereby
lessen the risk of lending to emerging market countries.
The United States has also endorsed the efforts of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank to increase the availability, frequency,
scope, and quality of the reported data of their member countries. Better
and more timely information can assist policy makers and investors to make
appropriate decisions. Some of these efforts include:
• The Financial Sector Assessment Program, which involves a rigorous
and in-depth analysis of a country’s financial system.
• The Special Data Dissemination Standard, which sets certain standards
of timeliness and quality for economic and financial statistics to guide
countries that have (or desire) access to foreign capital markets.
• The implementation of agreed-upon norms, such as the Code of Good
Practices and Fiscal Transparency, which emphasize adherence to
certain standards of good practice and promote quality accounting
procedures and fiscal transparency.
These programs help investors, public-sector lenders, and governments
identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities in firms, sectors, and the economy in
general. They also target areas for reform in a country’s macroeconomic
policy, financial sector, and supervisory systems. This combination of policies should help developed and developing countries take advantage of
greater capital market integration, while minimizing the risks.
Finally, the Millennium Challenge Account, a Presidential initiative enacted
in January 2004, provides incentives for developing countries to adopt policies that spur economic growth and reduce poverty. First-year funding for the

Chapter 13

| 251

Millennium Challenge Account is $1 billion. The Administration has
requested that this amount rise to $5 billion per year by fiscal year 2006. The
Millennium Challenge Corporation, which administers the Millennium
Challenge Account, will direct development grants to poor countries that
have appropriate economic, political, and structural conditions to benefit
from foreign assistance. The Millennium Challenge Corporation will partner
with countries that demonstrate a strong commitment to ruling justly,
investing in their people, and encouraging economic freedom in order to
develop their own strategies for catalyzing economic growth and reducing
poverty. The Millennium Challenge Account is designed to provide funding
for programs that have clear objectives, a sound financial plan, and measured
benchmarks for demonstrating progress in overcoming major obstacles to
sustained economic growth. The Millennium Challenge Account will not only
improve the ability of recipient countries to fight poverty and to grow more
quickly, but will also encourage the international investment that helps to
strengthen growth.

Conclusion
Underlying each of the policies promoted by the Administration is the
goal of helping countries reap the substantial benefits of the free flow of
international capital. Foreign direct investment can facilitate the transfer of
technology, allow for the development of markets and products, and
improve a country’s infrastructure. Portfolio flows can reduce the cost of
capital, improve competitiveness, and increase investment opportunities.
Bank flows can strengthen domestic financial institutions, improve financial
intermediation, and reduce vulnerability to crises. These flows are not
without their risks, but such risks can be reduced if countries adopt prudent
fiscal and monetary policies, strengthen financial and corporate institutions,
and develop the regulations and agencies that supervise such institutions.
Such steps allow countries to fully gain from free capital flows.

The Link Between Trade
and Capital Flows

M

ovements of goods and services across borders are often thought of as
distinct from international capital flows. For example, an individual
who allocates part of his or her retirement savings to a mutual fund that invests
in an international portfolio might not think that this cross-border transaction
has an impact on the price of imports, such as foreign cars or food at the supermarket. Yet, for important but subtle reasons, trade flows and capital flows are
closely intertwined—indeed, they are two sides of the same coin.
This chapter explores the linkages between trade and capital flows. The key
points in this chapter are:
• Changes in a country’s net international trade in goods and services,
captured by the current account, must be reflected in equal and opposite
changes in its net capital flows with the rest of the world.
• The United States has experienced a large net inflow of foreign capital in
recent years. Any such inflow must be accompanied by an equally large
current account deficit.
• The size and movement of current and capital accounts reflect fundamental
economic forces, including saving and investment rates, and relative
rates of growth across countries.

The Basic Accounting Identity
The balance of payments is the accounting system by which countries report
data on their international borrowing and lending, as well as on the flow of
goods and services in and out of the country. The balance of payments
includes a number of different accounts (Box 14-1). The central relationship
of the balance of payments is that the net flow of capital into a country, as
measured by the financial and capital accounts, must balance the net flow of
goods, services, transfer payments, and income receipts out of the country, as
measured by the current account.
When the current account balance is negative, this means that purchases of
foreign goods and services (and other outflows) exceed sales of goods and
services to foreigners (and other inflows). This situation is referred to as a
current account deficit. The trade balance is generally the largest component of
the current account and captures the net inflows of goods and services. A

253

positive net flow of capital into the United States means that foreigners are
purchasing more U.S. assets than U.S. citizens are purchasing foreign assets.
According to the balance of payments, a positive net flow of capital into the
United States must be balanced by a current account deficit.

Box 14-1: A New Look for the Balance of Payments
Just as a country’s national accounts keep track of macroeconomic
variables such as GDP saving, and investment, a country’s balance of
,
payments accounts serve as the bookkeeping for its international
transactions, such as exports, imports, and international investment
flows. In 1999, the Bureau of Economic Analysis announced that it
would adopt new terminology to be consistent with international best
practices for balance of payments accounting, as outlined by the
International Monetary Fund.
The old balance of payments system used two accounts: the capital
account and the current account. The new system uses three accounts
(Chart 14-1). The new current account includes the trade balance in
goods and services, net income receipts, and the balance of most
unilateral transfers (one-way transfers of assets, such as pension
payments to foreign residents). Some unilateral transfers, including
debt forgiveness and the transfer of bank accounts by foreign citizens
when immigrating to the United States, have been removed from the
old current account and are now in a separate account, the new
capital account. The new capital account represents a very small
portion of overall capital flows. Private capital flows and changes in
foreign and domestic reserves (formerly in the old capital account) are
now in the financial account. This new treatment preserves the
balance of payments identity that the sum of all the accounts is zero.
To simplify terminology, this Economic Report of the President
refers to the new capital and financial accounts as net capital flows—
that is, inflows of capital from foreign countries minus outflows from
the United States. Positive net capital flows indicate that more capital
is flowing into the United States than out.

254 | Economic Report of the President

To understand how the balance of payments works in practice, consider a
consumer in the United States who purchases a scarf from a foreign seller for
one dollar. This transaction is recorded as an import and reduces the U.S.
current account balance by one dollar. The foreign seller could spend the
dollar on U.S. goods or on U.S assets, such as stocks or bonds. If the
foreigner purchases U.S. goods, this would be recorded in the balance of
payments as a U.S. export in the current account. The U.S. purchase of the
foreign scarf and the foreign purchase of U.S. goods would cancel each other
out, so there would be no change in the current account and no change in
net capital flows. Alternatively, if the foreigner decided to purchase U.S.
assets, this would be recorded as a capital inflow into the United States. The
increase in net capital flows would balance the decrease in the U.S. current
account. In both examples, the resulting change in the current account, if
any, exactly balances any change in net capital flows.
Trade in goods can lead to changes in financial balances (such as with the
payment for the scarf in the example above), or financial transactions can
lead to changes in trade balances. The latter case would occur if a foreigner
purchased a U.S. asset, such as a bond, and the American seller of the bond
used the proceeds to purchase foreign goods. In both cases, the balance
between the current account and net capital flows still holds.
To understand how financial flows can affect trade balances, suppose that
at the prevailing rate of return, investors in the United States seek to undertake $200 billion worth of projects. If U.S. savers were willing to provide
only $150 billion in capital through saving, then the other
$50 billion could come from the rest of the world as $50 billion in capital
Chapter 14

| 255

inflows. If the U.S. investors choose to spend this capital inflow on foreign
goods (perhaps imports of new computers), then net purchases of foreign
goods would increase by $50 billion. The resulting $50 billion current
account deficit would balance the $50 billion capital inflow. If investors in
the United States were not able to obtain the initial $50 billion from abroad,
both net capital flows and the current account would equal zero. There would
be no current account deficit. Would this be good or bad? One immediate
effect would be that the $50 billion gap between desired investment and
saving would need to be closed by scaling back investment projects or raising
national saving. These changes should be evaluated on their own merits; there
is nothing particularly beneficial about having a trade balance or net capital
flows exactly equal to zero.
A country’s saving and investment decisions are critical to evaluating the
implication of any given level of its current account balance. In a world
without capital flows, the only funds available for investment come from
domestic saving. Capital flows allow a country to finance higher levels of
investment by drawing on funds from abroad. This net inflow of funds
corresponds to greater net purchases from the world and a decline in the
current account balance.
The desirability of positive net capital flows and a current account deficit
depend on what the capital inflows are used for. Household borrowing—an
excess of household spending or investment over saving—provides a useful
analogy. Household debt could reflect borrowing to finance an extravagant
vacation, a mortgage to buy a home, or a loan to finance education. Without
knowing its purpose, the appropriateness of the borrowing cannot be
judged. Similarly for countries, borrowing from abroad can be productive or
unproductive. Borrowing from abroad can be justified if it raises the potential output of the economy and this, in turn, generates the resources needed
to repay the foreign lenders.
This entire discussion has focused on trade balances and net capital flows
with the world as a whole, and not with any individual country. There is no
economic basis for concern about trade deficits and the corresponding net
capital flows with an individual trading partner when there are many countries
in the world (Box 14-2).

256 | Economic Report of the President

Box 14-2: Bilateral Versus Multilateral Balances
A country’s aggregate trade deficit matters only to the extent that it
reveals information about underlying economic forces, such as relative
international growth rates or national saving and investment patterns.
In contrast, bilateral deficits, such as the U.S. trade deficit with China,
reveal nothing about underlying economic forces in either country.
While trade barriers are a cause for concern, there is no economic
sense in which a bilateral deficit is either good or bad. It would be an
extraordinary coincidence if all countries had balanced trade with each
of their partners. One of the benefits of the international financial
system is that it frees countries from these bilateral constraints.
For example, imagine a simplified world that consisted of only the
United States, Australia, and China. Suppose the United States ships
$100 billion of machine tools to Australia and imports no goods in
return. Australia ships $100 billion of wheat to China with no reciprocal goods imports, and China ships $100 billion of toys to the United
States. Each country would have $100 billion of exports and $100
billion of imports, so that each would have balanced trade overall. Yet
some Americans might complain about their bilateral deficit with
China. Some Chinese might complain about their deficit with
Australia, and some Australians about their deficit with the United
States. All of these complaints would be unfounded; bilateral deficits
and surpluses are a natural consequence of a trading world
composed of many countries.
Domestic transactions provide a useful analogy. A plumber who
spends no more than he earns can still run a bilateral deficit with the
local grocer. The plumber can earn money from other sources to pay
the grocer and is not constrained to buying only from grocers who
have plumbing problems. The bilateral imbalance that exists between
the plumber and the grocer is an entirely natural feature of a wellfunctioning economy with a strong payments system and specialization.

Trends in the U.S. Balance of Payments
The decrease in the U.S. current account balance, from nearly zero in the
early 1990s to a deficit of about 5 percent of GDP in the first three quarters
of 2003, has been mirrored by a similar increase in net capital flows (Chart
14-2). (The two series in Chart 14-2 are not exact mirror images due to
imprecision in the measurement of trade and capital flows.)
Examining the components of the current and financial accounts provides
information on the causes of these recent trends in the U.S. balance of
payments (Table 14-1). Over the 1990s, a major contributor to the rise in the
current account deficit was the increase in imports of foreign goods. The trade
balance in goods moved from a deficit of 1.9 percent of GDP in 1990 to a
deficit of 4.6 percent of GDP in 2000. Exports of goods increased from 6.7
percent of GDP in 1990 to 7.9 percent of GDP in 2000, but goods imports
increased by much more, from 8.6 percent of GDP to 12.5 percent of GDP
over the same period. The increase in the current account deficit since 2000 has
resulted mainly from lower exports of goods (which fell from 7.9 percent to 6.4
percent of GDP between 2000 and the first three quarters of 2003), rather than
increased imports. Imports as a share of GDP actually fell 1 percentage point
over the same period (Chart 14-3 and Table 14-1). Most recently, the current
account deficit has narrowed from 5.2 percent of GDP in the first quarter of
2003 to 4.9 percent of GDP in the third, reflecting stronger export growth.

U.S. net capital flows grew from about 1 percent of GDP in 1990 to over
41⁄2 percent of GDP in 2000. This resulted from roughly equal increases in
foreign purchases of debt securities, equity securities, and direct investment.
This increase in net capital flows into the United States largely reflected the
desire of foreigners to participate in higher-return investment opportunities
in the United States. The global economic downturn and the collapse of
high-tech stock prices and broader equity indices that began in 2000
contributed to a shift in the composition of capital flows in the United
States. Foreign investors moved away from foreign direct investment and
private equity assets and toward government and corporate bonds. In addition, foreign governments increased their share of these capital flows,
although the foreign private sector still accounts for a far greater proportion.
Over the latter half of the 1990s and the early 2000s, the counterpart to the
rising U.S. current account deficit has been a growing wedge between U.S.
investment rates and U.S. national saving rates (Chart 14-4). The national
saving rate in the United States began to decline in 1999, but increased capital
inflows allowed U.S. investment rates to remain at a high level through 2000.
As discussed in Chapter 1, Lessons from the Recent Business Cycle, investment
fell substantially after the collapse of the stock market bubble of the late
1990s. In 2001, the decline in investment outpaced a contemporaneous
decline in U.S. saving, so that the current account deficit narrowed. U.S.
investment has since leveled off while saving remains low, causing a wider
U.S. current account deficit. Over the entire period, the availability of foreign
investment permitted the United States to maintain higher investment rates
than it could have funded relying solely on domestic financing. These capital
inflows have helped finance U.S. investments, expand U.S. productive
capacity, and strengthen U.S. economic performance.

Factors that Influence the Balance of Payments
A number of underlying economic factors influence the level of and
changes in the balance of payments. One of the most important factors is
the differential rate of GDP growth across countries. During the late 1990s,
the United States grew faster than many of its major trading partners, such
as Japan and a number of major European countries. As a result, capital
flowed into the United States, leading to a corresponding trade deficit. Even
during the recent business-cycle downturn and recovery, U.S. growth rates
have exceeded those of many of our major trading partners. This has
contributed to the slow recovery in U.S. exports and has helped to maintain
continued capital inflows into the United States.

260 | Economic Report of the President

A second determinant of trade and capital flows is the price of domestic
goods relative to foreign goods. Relative prices are influenced by a number
of factors, including labor and production costs, labor productivity, and
exchange rates. For many manufactured products, for example, labor and
production costs in developing countries are often below such costs in the
United States. As a result, the prices of these goods produced in developing
countries may be substantially lower than the price of similar goods
produced in the United States. For other products and projects, such as
airplanes and the development of new drugs, the availability of factors of
production such as skilled engineers may be more important than the availability of low-skilled workers. Exchange rates can also influence relative
prices. A depreciation of a country’s currency can make its products cheaper
and thus more competitive abroad, even if domestic prices do not change.
When a country’s currency appreciates, domestically produced goods
become relatively more expensive in foreign markets.
A third determinant of the direction and size of capital flows is the relative
return that investors expect to make in one country compared with another.
This return differential can reflect factors discussed earlier, such as relative
output growth, labor costs, or exchange rates. This differential can also

Chapter 14

| 261

depend on a country’s legal framework, accounting and tax systems,
infrastructure, culture, and institutions. The flow of capital into the United
States likely reflects a view that the expected risk-adjusted, after-tax return on
U.S. assets is higher than the return on similar foreign investments.
These factors—growth rates, relative prices, and rates of return—all drive
national saving and investment decisions. Those decisions most directly
determine the balance of payments. National saving is the sum of private
saving (saving of households and corporations) and public saving (the total
saving of Federal, State, and local governments, as reflected in their budget
balances). When national saving is less than domestic investment, a country
must be borrowing from abroad. This borrowing will be reflected in positive
net capital flows and a current account deficit.
Although this suggests that the recent increase in the U.S. budget deficit
may be related to the recent increase in the U.S. current account deficit, the
historical evidence for a relationship between government deficits and trade
deficits is mixed. A number of academic studies suggest that other domestic
and international factors are more important influences on current account
balances than government deficits. The recent U.S. experience supports this.
In the 1990s, the large increase in the U.S. current account deficit occurred
while the Federal budget surplus was growing (Chart 14-5). From 1997 to
2000, the U.S. current account deficit increased by almost 3 percentage
points. Over the same period, the U.S. budget balance went from a slight
deficit to a surplus of 21⁄2 percent of GDP. Since 2000, the U.S. budget has
moved into deficit by several percentage points of GDP, but the current
account deficit has widened by only about 1 percentage point of GDP. These
figures show that the current account and Federal budget do not move in
lockstep, and that the government deficit is only one of several factors
behind the widening of the current account deficit since the mid-1990s.

262 | Economic Report of the President

Possible Paths of Balance of
Payments Adjustment
The U.S. current account deficit reached about 5 percent of GDP in the
first three quarters of 2003. Historically, many countries with sizable current
account deficits have experienced reductions in capital flows and corresponding reductions in their current account deficits. Because the U.S. current
account deficit and U.S. capital inflows are balanced by trade and capital
flows in other countries, any change in the U.S. balance of payments would
involve corresponding changes in other countries’ flows of trade and capital.
The economic implications of any adjustments depend on how it occurs.
An adjustment in the U.S. trade balance could involve a number of
domestic and global factors. For example, faster growth in other countries
would be expected to increase demand for U.S. exports and narrow the U.S.
current account deficit. Slower growth in the United States relative to its
major trading partners would dampen U.S. demand for imports and reduce
the U.S. trade deficit. Trade flows could also adjust through changes in the
relative prices of U.S. goods and services compared to the prices of foreign
goods and services. This relative-price adjustment could occur through
changes in nominal exchange rates or through different inflation rates in
different countries.
Chapter 14

| 263

An adjustment in the U.S. balance of payments would also require a
change in international capital flows. To reduce net capital flows, foreign
investors could buy fewer U.S. assets and/or U.S. investors could buy more
foreign assets. This might occur if U.S. national saving were to increase,
thereby reducing the need for foreign funds to finance U.S. domestic investment. The U.S. investment rate could also fall, so that the United States
required less capital inflow. Lower investment is the least desirable form of
adjustment for the balance of payments, however, as it would reduce U.S.
productive capacity and lead to slower growth.
It is impossible to predict the exact timing or magnitude of any adjustment
in the U.S. current account balance. After a large increase in the U.S. current
account deficit in the 1980s, the ensuing adjustments were gradual and
benign. Public policies can facilitate changes in the U.S. current account and
net capital flows by creating a stable macroeconomic and financial environment, encouraging foreign growth, and spurring increased saving in the
United States.

Conclusion
Flows of goods and services across borders are linked to international
capital flows through the balance of payments. Changes in the current
account (which includes international trade in goods and services) must be
balanced by equal and opposite changes in net capital flows with the rest of
the world. Similarly, movements in net capital flows require offsetting
movements in the current account.
In recent years, the United States has received large net inflows of foreign
capital, which have been balanced by large U.S. current account deficits.
The U.S. balance of payments is mirrored by trade and capital flows in other
countries. Thus, over the same period, the rest of the world as a whole has
experienced a current account surplus and capital outflows.
The United States’ sizable positive net capital flows and the corresponding
trade deficits are neither good nor bad in and of themselves. Instead, they
represent underlying economic forces, such as relative GDP growth rates,
relative prices of domestic and foreign goods, relative returns on investment,
and national saving and investment decisions. Changes in these underlying
factors would lead to changes in the U.S. balance of payments and
corresponding changes in the international flows of trade and capital.

Report to the President on the
Activities of the Council of Economic
Advisers During 2003
The Council of Economic Advisers was established by the Employment Act
of 1946 to provide the President with objective economic analysis and advice
on the development and implementation of a wide range of domestic and
international economic policy issues.

The Chairman of the Council
N. Gregory Mankiw was appointed by the President as Chairman on May 29,
2003. Dr. Mankiw replaced R. Glenn Hubbard, who returned to Columbia
University where he is the Russell L. Carson Professor of Economics and Finance
and Co-Director of the Entrepreneurship Program in the Graduate School of
Business and Professor of Economics in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Dr.
Mankiw is on leave from Harvard University, where he is the Allie S. Freed
Professor of Economics.
Dr. Mankiw is responsible for communicating the Council’s views on
economic matters directly to the President through personal discussions and
written reports. He represents the Council at Cabinet meetings, meetings of
the National Economic Council, daily White House senior staff meetings,
budget team meetings with the President, and other formal and informal
meetings with the President. He also travels within the United States and overseas to present the Administration’s views on the economy. Dr. Mankiw is the
Council's chief public spokesperson. He directs the work of the Council and
exercises ultimate responsibility for the work of the professional staff.

The Members of the Council
Kristin J. Forbes is a Member of the Council of Economic Advisers.
Dr. Forbes is on leave from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan
School of Management where she is the Mitsubishi Career Development
Chair of International Management and Associate Professor of International
Management in the Applied Economics Group. She previously served as
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Quantitative Policy Analysis and Latin
American and Caribbean Nations at the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
Appendix A

| 269

Harvey S. Rosen is also a Member of the Council of Economic Advisers. Dr.
Rosen is on leave from Princeton University, where he is the John L. Weinberg
Professor of Economics and Business Policy. Dr. Rosen previously served as Deputy
Assistant Secretary for Tax Analysis at the U.S. Department of the Treasury.
The Chairman and the Members work as a team on most economic policy
issues. Dr. Mankiw is primarily responsible for the Council’s macroeconomic
analysis including the Administration’s economic forecast. Dr. Forbes’ responsibilities include international finance and trade issues, with a particular focus
on emerging markets and developing economies. Dr. Rosen’s responsibilities
include policy analysis relating to taxation and microeconomic issues
including labor markets, health care, and regulation.

Macroeconomic Policies
As is its tradition, the Council devoted much time during 2003 to assisting
the President in formulating economic policy objectives and designing
programs to implement them. In this regard the Chairman kept the President
informed, on a continuing basis, of important macroeconomic developments
and other major policy issues through regular macroeconomic briefings. The
Council prepares for the President, the Vice President, and the White House
senior staff almost daily memoranda that report key economic data and analyze
current economic events. In addition, they prepare weekly discussion and data
memos for the President, Vice President and senior White House staff.
The Council, the Department of the Treasury, and the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB)—the Administration’s economic “troika”—are responsible
for producing the economic forecasts that underlie the Administration’s
budget proposals. The Council, under the leadership of the Chairman and the
Chief Economist, initiates the forecasting process twice each year. In preparing
these forecasts, the Council consults with a variety of outside sources,
including leading private sector forecasters.
In 2003, the Council took part in discussions on a range of macroeconomic
issues. An important concern in the first half of the year was in providing
analysis related to the President’s Jobs and Growth proposal, which took effect
in midyear. An important subsequent interest was then in assessing the response
of the economy, and the labor market in particular, to fiscal and monetary policies. The Council works closely with the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and
other government agencies in providing analyses to the Administration on these
topics of concern. In 2003, the Council worked closely with the National
Economic Council, the Office of Management and Budget, and other offices
within the Executive Office of the President in assessing the economy and
economic policy proposals.

270 | Economic Report of the President

The Council continued its efforts to improve the public’s understanding of
economic issues and of the Administration’s economic agenda through regular
briefings with the economic and financial press, frequent discussions with
outside economists, and presentations to outside organizations. The Chairman
also regularly exchanged views on the economy with the Chairman and
Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

International Economic Policies
The Council was involved in a range of international trade issues, including
discussions on trade liberalization at the global, regional, and bilateral levels.
The Council contributed to the development of U.S. positions in talks on free
trade agreements with Australia, Central America, Morocco, the Southern
African Customs Union, and to the development of positions for the
ongoing negotiations on the Doha Development Agenda at the World Trade
Organization and for the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas. The Council
participated in deliberations concerning trade policy in a number of industries, including steel and softwood lumber. The Council also provided analysis
related to U.S. economic interaction with China and the impact of trade on
the manufacturing sector.
The Council participated in discussions concerning international financial
policy involving many countries, including Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, China,
the Dominican Republic, Iraq, Japan, the Philippines, and Turkey. The
Council participated in the development of U.S. proposals for a number of
heads of state summits, including the leaders of the G8 nations and the Special
Summit of the Americas in early 2004. The Council also provided analysis in
support of efforts to promote economic stability and growth in Iraq.
The Council is a leading participant in the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD), the principal forum for economic
cooperation among the high-income industrial countries. The Chairman
heads the U.S. delegation to the semiannual meetings of the OECD’s
Economic Policy Committee (EPC) and serves as the EPC Chairman.
Dr. Kroszner and Dr. Forbes participated in meetings of the OECD’s Working
Party 3 on macroeconomic policy and coordination. Council staff participated
in the OECD’s Working Party 1 on microeconomic policy, in the annual
OECD review of U.S. economic policy, and in the OECD Ad Hoc Group on
Sustainable Development.
Council members regularly met with representatives of the Council’s
counterpart agencies in foreign countries, as well as with foreign trade ministers,
other government officials, and members of the private sector. During the year
the Council represented the United States at other international forums as well,
including meetings of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC).

Microeconomic Policies
A wide variety of microeconomic issues received Council attention during
2003. The Council actively participated in the Cabinet-level National
Economic Council, dealing with issues including energy policy, the environment, international tax policy, reform of Medicare, pensions, transportation,
homeland security, technology, and financial markets. Dr. Rosen was involved
in formulating policy concerning the supervisory regime for governmentsponsored enterprises in the home mortgage system.
The Council worked on a variety of environmental issues in 2003. The
Council played a role in the development of proposed mercury standards, as
well as in the proposed Inter-State Air Quality Rule, which seeks to regulate
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions from power plants. The Council
participated in discussions on the final rule to clarify the routine maintenance,
repair and replacement exclusion under EPA’s New Source Review program.
The Council also helped in the revision of the OMB Guidelines for the
Conduct of Regulatory Analysis and the Format of Accounting Statements. The
Council analyzed proposed revisions to the voluntary registry for greenhouse
gases, and aided in the review and updating of models concerning the
Administration’s Clear Skies legislative proposal.
Energy policy was an important focus of the Council’s efforts in 2003, with
analysis on topics including the impact of high natural gas prices and problems
with the electricity transmission grid. The Council also played a role in the
deregulation of computer reservation systems, as well as a number of other technology issues including the exploration of space, telecommunications and
broadband, spectrum allocation, and spam. The Council also participated in
discussions concerning reforms to corporate governance, government-sponsored
enterprises, financial privacy rules, pensions, the Postal Service, and tort reform.
During 2003, the Council participated in discussions on a number of issues
related to labor markets and social policies. These issues included Medicare
reform and the provision of prescription drug benefits within Medicare, health
information technology, medical malpractice liability, unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation, immigration, college financial aid, and the
President’s proposal for re-employment accounts. The Council was also
involved in discussions on agriculture, transportation, and homeland security.

General Notes
Detail in these tables may not add to totals because of rounding.
Because of the formula used for calculating real gross domestic product (GDP),
the chained (2000) dollar estimates for the detailed components do not add to the
chained-dollar value of GDP or to any intermediate aggregate. The Department of
Commerce (Bureau of Economic Analysis) no longer publishes chained-dollar estimates prior to 1990, except for selected series.
Unless otherwise noted, all dollar figures are in current dollars.
Symbols used:
p Preliminary.
... Not available (also, not applicable).
Data in these tables reflect revisions made by the source agencies through January 28, 2004. In particular, tables containing national income and product accounts (NIPA) estimates reflect the comprehensive (benchmark) revision released
by the Department of Commerce in December 2003.

NAICS:

1 Inventories at end of quarter. Quarter-to-quarter change calculated from this table is not the current-dollar change in private inventories
component of GDP. The former is the difference between two inventory stocks, each valued at its respective end-of-quarter prices. The latter
is the change in the physical volume of inventories valued at average prices of the quarter. In addition, changes calculated from this table
are at quarterly rates, whereas change in private inventories is stated at annual rates.
2 Inventories of construction, mining, and utilities establishments are included in other industries through 1995.
3 Quarterly totals at monthly rates. Final sales of domestic business equals final sales of domestic product less gross value added of
households and institutions and of general government and includes a small amount of final sales by farm and by government enterprises.
Note.—The industry classification of inventories is on an establishment basis. Estimates through 1995 are based on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). Beginning with 1996, estimates are based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).

5 Not strictly comparable with earlier data due to population adjustments or other changes. See Employment and Earnings for details on
breaks in series.
6 Beginning in 2000, data for agricultural employment are for agricultural and related industries; data for this series and for nonagricultural employment are not strictly comparable with data for earlier years. Because of independent seasonal adjustment for these two
series, monthly data will not add to total civilian employment.
Note.—Labor force data in Tables B-35 through B-44 are based on household interviews and relate to the calendar week including the
12th of the month. For definitions of terms, area samples used, historical comparability of the data, comparability with other series, etc., see
Employment and Earnings.

Note (cont’d).—private household workers; which count persons as employed when they are not at work because of industrial disputes, bad
weather, etc., even if they are not paid for the time off; which are based on a sample of the working-age population; and which count persons only once—as employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force. In the data shown here, persons who work at more than one job are
counted each time they appear on a payroll.
Establishment data for employment, hours, and earnings are classified based on the 2002 North American Industry Classification System
(NAICS).
For further description and details see Employment and Earnings.

1 Annual data are averages of monthly not seasonally adjusted figures.
2 Seasonally adjusted, end of period. Inventories beginning January 1982 for manufacturing and December 1980 for wholesale and retail
trade are not comparable with earlier periods.
3 Inventory/sales ratio. Annual data are: beginning 1982, averages of monthly ratios; for 1965–81, ratio of December inventories to monthly
average sales for the year; and for earlier years, weighted averages. Monthly ratios are inventories at end of month to sales for month.
4 Food services included on SIC basis and excluded on NAICS basis. See last column for retail and food services sales.
5 Effective in 2001, data classified based on North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Data on NAICS basis available beginning 1992. Earlier data based on Standard Industrial Classification (SIC).
Data include semiconductors.
Note.—Earlier data are not strictly comparable with data beginning 1967 for wholesale and retail trade.

1 CPI-U-X1 is a rental equivalence approach to homeowners’ costs for the CPI-U for years prior to 1983, the first year for which the official
index incorporates such a measure. CPI-U-X1 is rebased to the December 1982 value of the CPI-U (1982-84=100) and is identical with CPI-U
data from December 1982 forward. Data prior to 1967 estimated by moving the series at the same rate as the CPI-U for each year.
2 CPI research series using current methods (CPI-U-RS) introduced in June 1999. Data for 2003 are preliminary. All data are subject to revision annually.
3 Chained consumer price index introduced in August 2002. Data for 2002 and 2003 are subject to revision.

5 For monthly data, high and low for the period. Prime rate for 1929–33 and 1947–48 are ranges of the rate in effect during the period.
6 Discount window borrowing for primary credit and discount rate (adjustment credit). The rate for primary credit replaced the rate for adjustment credit under an amendment to the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation A, effective January 9, 2003.
7 Since July 19, 1975, the daily effective rate is an average of the rates on a given day weighted by the volume of transactions at these
rates. Prior to that date, the daily effective rate was the rate considered most representative of the day’s transactions, usually the one at
which most transactions occurred.
8 From October 30, 1942, to April 24, 1946, a preferential rate of 0.50 percent was in effect for advances secured by Government securities maturing in 1 year or less.

1 For SIC data, includes primary metal industries, not shown separately.
2 Industry groups shown in column headings reflect NAICS classification for data beginning 1998. For data on SIC basis, the industry
groups would be, machinery—industrial machinery and equipment; electrical equipment, appliances, and components—electronic and other
electric equipment; motor vehicles, bodies and trailers, and parts—motor vehicles and equipment; food and beverage and tobacco products—
food and kindred products; and chemical products—chemicals and allied products.
3 Industry data based on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) are based on the 1987 SIC for data beginning 1987 and on the 1972
SIC for earlier data shown. Data on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) are based on the 1997 NAICS.
Industry groups shown on SIC and NAICS basis are not necessarily the same and are not strictly comparable.

1 In the old series, ‘‘income taxes’’ refers to Federal income taxes only, as State and local income taxes had already been deducted. In the
new series, no income taxes have been deducted.
2 Annual data are average equity for the year (using four end-of-quarter figures).
3 Beginning 1988, profits before and after income taxes reflect inclusion of minority stockholders’ interest in net income before and after
income taxes.
4 Data for 1992 (most significantly 1992:I) reflect the early adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 106 (Employer’s
Accounting for Post-Retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions) by a large number of companies during the fourth quarter of 1992. Data for
1993 (1993:I) also reflect adoption of Statement 106. Corporations must show the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in
the first quarter of the year in which the change is adopted.
5 Data based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). Other data shown are based on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC).
Note.—Data are not necessarily comparable from one period to another due to changes in accounting principles, industry classifications,
sampling procedures, etc. For explanatory notes concerning compilation of the series, see ‘‘Quarterly Financial Report for Manufacturing,
Mining, and Trade Corporations,’’ Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census.

Total

1 Farm population as defined by Department of Agriculture and Department of Commerce, i.e., civilian population living on farms in rural
areas, regardless of occupation. Series discontinued in 1992.
2 Total population of United States including Armed Forces overseas, as of July 1.
3 Includes persons doing farmwork on all farms. These data, published by the Department of Agriculture, differ from those on agricultural
employment by the Department of Labor (see Table B-35) because of differences in the method of approach, in concepts of employment, and
in time of month for which the data are collected.
4 Prior to 1982 this category was termed ‘‘family workers’’ and did not include nonfamily unpaid workers. Series discontinued in 2002.
5 Acreage harvested plus acreages in fruits, tree nuts, and vegetables and minor crops.
6 Based on new definition of a farm. Under old definition of a farm, farm population (in thousands and as percent of total population) for
1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, and 1983 is 7,806 and 3.6; 8,005 and 3.6; 7,553 and 3.4; 7,241 and 3.2; 7,014 and 3.1; 6,880 and 3.0;
7,029 and 3.0, respectively.
7 Basis for farm employment series was discontinued for 1981 through 1984. Employment is estimated for these years.

Note.—Population includes Alaska and Hawaii beginning 1960.

1 End-use commodity classifications beginning 1978 and 1989 are not strictly comparable with data for earlier periods. See Survey of Current Business, June 1988 and July 2001.

Note.—Data are on a balance of payments basis and exclude military.
In June 1990, end-use categories for goods exports were redefined to include reexports; beginning with data for 1978, reexports (exports of
foreign goods) are assigned to detailed end-use categories in the same manner as exports of domestic goods.

1 Department of Defense shipments of grant-aid military supplies and equipment under the Military Assistance Program are excluded from
total exports through 1985 and included beginning 1986.
2 F.a.s. (free alongside ship) value basis at U.S. port of exportation for exports and at foreign port of exportation for imports.
3 Beginning 1989, exports have been adjusted for undocumented exports to Canada and are included in the appropriate end-use categories.
For prior years, only total exports include this adjustment.
4 Total includes ‘‘other’’ exports or imports, not shown separately.
5 Total arrivals of imported goods other than intransit shipments.
6 Total includes revisions not reflected in detail.
7 Total exports are on a revised statistical month basis; end-use categories are on a statistical month basis.
Note.—Goods on a Census basis are adjusted to a BOP basis by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, in line with concepts and definitions
used to prepare international and national accounts. The adjustments are necessary to supplement coverage of Census data, to eliminate
duplication of transactions recorded elsewhere in international accounts, and to value transactions according to a standard definition.
Data include trade of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Foreign Trade Zones.

1 Prior

to 1991 data are for West Germany only.
2 Civilian unemployment rates, approximating U.S. concepts. Quarterly data for France and Germany should be viewed as less precise indicators of unemployment under U.S. concepts than the annual data.
3 There are breaks in the series for Germany (1983 and 1991), France (1992), Italy (1986, 1991, and 1993), and United States (1990 and
1994). Also, for Italy, data reflect new estimation procedures and updated population data introduced in July 1999. For details on break in
series in 1990 and 1994 for United States, see footnote 5, Table B-35. For details on break in series for other countries, see U.S. Department
of Labor Comparative Civilian Labor Force Statistics, Ten Countries: 1959–2002, April 2003.
4 Hourly compensation in manufacturing, U.S. dollar basis. Data relate to all employed persons (employees and self-employed workers) in
the United States, Canada, Japan, France, Germany, and United Kingdom, and to employees (wage and salary earners) in Italy. For Canada,
France and United Kingdom, compensation adjusted to include changes in employment taxes that are not compensation to employees, but are
labor costs to employers.
Data for U.S. are as of early December 2003; other data are as of September 2003.
